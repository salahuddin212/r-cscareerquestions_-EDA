1npuhx8,Does every company kind of suck right now? The industry as a whole feels like its gotten more intense,"Am I wrong to think that basically every company kind of sucks right now? I feel like since the start of this year especially every company is making their devs work 50+ hours while also doing mass layoffs.

I've been interviewing with different companies and there have been multiple instances where they expect the candidate to work 50-60 hours a week, come into the office 5x a week, or work 6 days out of the week. This shit sucks.

Big tech has gotten intense and stressful so its hard to chill there. Startups have insane competition and are tight on money so the expectations are you working super hard to make this thing survive.

I understand this isn't true for 100% of companies but it feels like at least 70% of companies kind of suck to work at as a SWE. And by suck I mostly mean super stressful despite the pay and perks still being pretty good.

In conclusion, if every company kind of sucks I might as well take the highest paid role I can since they're all going to have intense expectations.

I went in to work this morning as usual, and then my manager took me aside into a conference room and let me know I was being laid off.

I’ve got around ~4YoE as a full stack SWE

I’m currently working on an enterprise RAG system using LLMs for internal data retrieval and agentic processes. It’s pretty interesting and using new tech is fun, but tbh I feel like I’m not learning anything super new. I’m more so dealing with teaching coworkers things and suggesting new tech/planning things and bureaucracy and broken processes everywhere. Shit takes forever to get done and is just mired in confusion with where the business will go and if there’s even value in these tools. IMO it may get eaten up my Copilot if Copilot ever gets good. I’ve made a good amount of decisions and driven some feature work for things, and felt like I have deserved senior for a while. My manager has said for like the past year he wants to promote me, and he even said that he would promote me when I joined this team (I joined from his old team), but that has yet to be seen.

I’ve recently interviewed and got an offer internally for a senior SWE role on a team focused on the JavaScript SDK for Peacock, which I think seems super interesting, but will be less FullStack work and more Video Streaming work. I think that it’s really interesting to work on that system, even if it’s not Netflix level scale yet, I think learning about streaming systems seems like a cool problem. It’s also I think a pathway/door that opens opportunities at somewhere like Netflix (I hope at least lol) I also feel like it will help me grow as a dev, since tbh I don’t feel like I’m learning from others on this team as much as I feel I have to teach others/we don’t have proper guidance. The staff engineers on my current team are anything but. I had some solid staff engs on my last team that I looked up to and respected. This AI team idk, no one is stepping up to drive. When I have, I’ve been discouraged by the current staff engineers, so I just feel like it’s not worth trying.

Curious though on if others would choose to stay on the AI team and why

TL;DR - 4YoE fullstack dev stuck on AI/RAG team with broken processes, no mentorship, and manager who’s been promising promotion to senior for 1+ years.

The staff engineers on my current team are anything but. I had some solid staff engs on my last team that I looked up to and respected. This AI team idk, no one is stepping up to drive. When I have, I’ve been discouraged by the current staff engineers, so I just feel like it’s not worth trying.

Curious though on if others would choose to stay on the AI team and why

TL;DR - 4YoE fullstack dev stuck on AI/RAG team with broken processes, no mentorship, and manager who’s been promising promotion to senior for 1+ years. Got internal offer for actual senior SWE role on Peacock’s video streaming SDK team.

1npj6yn,Am I right in wanting to leave my current role to pursue internships,"I’m a little over halfway done with my bachelors degree and I have been working part time as a software developer for a couple of years at a medium sized non-tech company. We built software only meant to be used in-house. I’m based in Canada. 

I’m not sure if my grievances are only at my current job or a general aspect of the industry which is why I want your input. 

My grievances:

- Most of the newer interesting projects have been given to a colleague.

- The work culture promotes having one developer undertake multiple projects at the same time in completely different areas of development. Software quality and technical debt might as well be seen as real as Santa Claus. 

- To add to the second bullet point, the people that have been promoted as managers or provided with more interesting projects during my time here have been the type of person that simply can not say no or question the tasks given by the director of our team.

- The director doesn’t seem to understand software. A few years ago he chased the automation, low-code, no-code trend. Now he’s chasing the generative AI trend. We are building what could have been simple forms as chatbots smh. 

- We rely too much on consultants that are either incompetent or at times purposely doing things to make projects take longer. 

- To add to the previous point. We don’t have senior staff to challenge what different consultants are doing.

Background:  
I have a chemistry PhD from an ivy league, worked for 5 years in management consulting (MBB) afterwards, then founded 2-3 startups as a PM/growth lead (raised a few $M but no exit). Doing contract consulting now again. Pays very well but ""recoloring boxes"" is soul sucking.

If needed, I could likely sustain myself for a few years with savings (not saying I want to do that)

Where I am:  
I've done research on a potential career path, especially combining my chemistry PhD with AI/ML. I have basic coding experience, started learning python now (Dr Chuck from Michigan) and looking into AI classes from Stanford.

1npq5y4,AI is genuinely very helpful,"I'm a junior CS student, but I've been freelancing for a few (~3) years now, working as a full stack developer (Django/FastAPI and React). And recently I've come to rely a lot on coding agents and LLMs in general.

Case in point; today, I had to optimise one of the CI/CD pipelines I set up for one of my clients. It was taking around 3 minutes to build and deploy the entire app, and push the images to ECR as well.

Of course, I know a thing or two about how this generally works already, so I sorta knew what to do. I was in the middle of heavily modifying our dependency management tools (moving from pip to uv, cleaning up Dockerfiles and entrypoint scripts), so I decided to finish that first. However once I did, I noticed that the build times had shot up to 8 minutes now.

With the help of GPT-5, I was able to reduce this to ~1m30s. I essentially pasted in the entire GA workflow and asked ""any opportunities for improving caching?"" since I saw a lot of unnecessary reinstalls in the workflow, and it pointed out that one of the cache keys was always going to miss, because I was using the SHA of the commit to build it.

Then there were a bunch of other minor things it helped out with as well. I was using Docker Watch and a mounted volume to sync the codebase and my local containers, and uv kept overwriting my venv. With some prodding, Copilot modified the Dockerfile to create the venv within the container outside of the mounted volume, which fixed the issue.

I know a lot of these things can be googled, but you have to sort of already know what you're looking for to find a good solution. I find that, in the absence of any senior developer mentorship, AI helps me fill the gap quite a bit. A lot of the time I use it to just mull over various approaches to a solution, and when I feel confident enough in its response, I even let it write the code.

1nphqhe,Technically Ageing Out: Turn that Music Down and Get off my Lawn,"I had an interview last week for a 3-month contract to port some Ruby automation code to a Python-based framework --which is work I've been doing now for a couple years with an impressive track record.

I'm a fresher with almost 10 months of experience in a mid-size company. For my training period I was put in the internal team, it was kind of a bench though. The internal team has some permanent members and the others are temporary people who are put on bench. So, if the company's doing layoffs, you're they're the first ones to go. As the team isn't that big, the temporary members can be made permanent but if a client needs anyone, they can be transferred mid-project. I was having fun doing what I was doing. Not much pressure, chill team, etc.

But then a couple of months ago I was transferred to another team that's in its initial phase. We have to build a PoC for now. The team consists of only 2 fresher developers including me and the workload is a little too much. There are tight deadlines because we are an AI team and we have copilot at our disposal but it's not enough. I'm not liking this pressure and it's taking a toll on my mental health. Sometimes we have to work on weekends too. Now I feel like coding is not for me. And my manager also does a little micromanagement and keeps on irritating us.

Can I talk to my manager about going back to my previous team as it's not working out for me?

1nozzfb,Long-term disability insurance in the CS field,"So this might be more for /r/personalfinance or /r/insurance, but most of the material I already see there is more for the medical field, not quite tech/CS.

I am considering taking out long-term disability insurance for myself, but part of me has reservations over whether or not a standalone policy is worth it. I am a year out of college and currently living with family, but planning to move out - hopefully soon, when I can find a place that I like enough.

Right this moment I don't really need the income replacement - hopefully, I have savings that can cover a good amount of medical expenses with insurance or whatever, and I live with family at home; what I can't cover, though, is the loss of income for retirement savings. Once I move out, though, I probably want such a policy anyway.

There is part of me that feels like such a policy isn't worth it, because it seems like what would disable me would be a bit more than, say, my father who is a dentist and if he loses any part of his hands, he is done for, and so has a DI policy. I think I may be able to get by with assistive technology if need be (i.e hand injury), but knock on wood I won't need to. I do have sports hobbies after work and so there is a risk that I will be injured or whatever, but of course knock on wood that doesn't happen.

My employer offers me STD/LTD (180 day waiting period) but I declined it because

1. my company provides me a bank of ""disability sick leave"" hours that covers a decent amount of what their STD would give me,
2. their long-term disability policy has a transition to ""any occupation"" after two years (the example on [Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Disability_insurance#Notional_example_2) regarding the ""handing out stickers at Walmart is an occupation"" scared me away), but now that I read it closer, this may have been a mistake because my group policy is actually ""any occupation for which you earn >=80% of your pre-disability salary"",
3. I probably want a disability policy that is separate from my employer, if I was to get one,
4. The premiums for the group policy appear to vary based on age; I don't know how they are calculated, but based on the ""conversion to individual policy"" paperwork (if you leave, you can convert the group policy to an individual policy) it appears to vary based on age, increasing every five years (i.e. at age 25, 30, 35, etc.), and the rates can change every year. I was told a good policy has a fixed rate with no changes.

The employer provided LTD is dirt cheap (like <$5 a paycheck) - actually, now that I write this, I'm not sure why I waived it to begin with. The quotes I have been getting (90-day waiting period, $60K of benefits, ""true own occupation"") have been around ~$100-$130/month. But, I am told that private policies only get more expensive the later you wait to buy (once health problems show up), and once you have the employer-provided LTD, private companies don't want to overinsure you and so won't issue you a policy until you drop the employer LTD.

I was recently offered a software development role at a small non-tech company. I will be helping to migrate legacy software to a more modern stack.

There is no “stack” as in the guy currently working on it is still figuring stuff out so I think I’ll have a lot of say in what we end up using.

On the other hand, I have a contract position possible with a government agency. They use a modern stack and there are other SWEs working there full time so I’d have more support. The issue is this is the pay is much lower and given the unpredictability of the current government, it’s not certain I’d be able to renew my contract / potentially work there as a government employee.

Hi [My Name],

My name is [Name 1], and I work closely with [Name 2], who leads our software development team. We are currently exploring a new business concept and reaching out to a select group of professionals whose perspectives we greatly value.

We’d love the opportunity to walk you through the idea and hear your feedback in a brief, informal conversation. It’s not a presentation, but rather an open exchange of thoughts that could help shape our direction. 

If you’re open to this, please feel free to schedule a time through Benjamin’s calendar here: https://calendly.com/[Name 2]/30min

Warm regards, [Name 1]

Hi [My Name],

My name is [Name 1], and I work closely with [Name 2], who leads our software development team. We are currently exploring a new business concept and reaching out to a select group of professionals whose perspectives we greatly value.

We’d love the opportunity to walk you through the idea and hear your feedback in a brief, informal conversation. It’s not a presentation, but rather an open exchange of thoughts that could help shape our direction. 

If you’re open to this, please feel free to schedule a time through Benjamin’s calendar here: https://calendly.com/[Name 2]/30min

Warm regards, [Name 1]

""That's right! PAIR sockets create an exclusive one-to-one connection - only one client can connect to the server at any given time.

Think about this constraint in the context of different use cases:

* When might you want this exclusive pairing behavior?
* How is this different from the PUB/SUB pattern you were using earlier, where multiple subscribers could connect to one publisher?
* What about REQ/REP - can multiple REQ clients connect to one REP server?

1nnekhu,The HIRE Act 2025: the only real effort to regulate offshoring and reinvest billions in U.S. jobs,"Right now, U.S. companies spend over $161 billion every year on offshore tech services from India alone. The HIRE Act 2025 proposes a 25% tax on offshore spending, which would generate about $40 billion annually. That figure comes just from U.S. spending in India, before even considering other countries. Instead of disappearing overseas, that money would be reinvested here at home, funding apprenticeships, reskilling programs, and workforce training. In practice, that means more Americans getting the chance to learn in-demand tech skills, land better jobs, and actually compete for the roles that are currently being offshored.

With the new $100K H-1B fees, companies will likely push even more jobs offshore. That’s why the HIRE Act matters, it’s the only effort on the table to regulate offshoring and redirect that money into building up our own workforce.

Money-hungry U.S. companies keep chasing lower costs overseas instead of putting resources into developing Americans and strengthening the US economy.

1no5f5j,Offered a low starting contractor rate...do I take it?,"Hey all,

I have a complex situation, I'm from California but I've mostly been living in the UK for the past few years (with sponsorship). I've been offered a role at a startup that wants me to be UK-based but they don't have their sponsorship license and aren't rushing to get it. They think the process will take 2-3 months.

So, they want me to start as a US-based contractor. Problem is, they're only offering me $8,333/month. That barely covers my costs, let alone they expect me to pay for the visa (almost $7k) and they expect me to pay my own travel back and forth for their monthly in-person in London (they said they'd pay my flights in the interview).

I pushed back and they offered $10k/mo, but this is still so low. I had been excited to work there, the UK salary they're offering is decent, but this is just demoralizing. I'll basically have to dip into my savings to work for them, they don't seem to understand the costs that a contractor incurs. The CEO gave some chat about bootstrapping it with limited cashflow, but it's a spinoff from an existing company that's been around for 70 years, so unless he has mismanaged that company they should be able to offer decent comp.

Also, they were aware from when I started interviewing in July that I would not be based fulltime in London due to my caring responsibilities in California. I don't even have a flat in London at the minute. They said they'd cover flights and I'd cover accommodation. The market is bad so okay. But I have my mom's dog to care for in California and I live an 8 hour drive from a big airport, so I need parking or an uber from a relative's house or something -- essentially getting to/from airports will cost as much as an economy flight. The UK salary offered is 80k, which will seem low here but trust me, it's not bad. I don't have a ton of experience.

That's the other weird thing, I don't have a ton of experience, but they think I'll be fine in essentially a CTO role for this startup. I'm the sole SWE. So on the one hand 80k GBP is not horrible in the UK for my experience level; on the other hand given the amount of responsibility it is low.

But anyways, the main issue is what to do about the lowball contractor rate for California. I can't afford to live on that and fly to London and pay the visa. They could get the visa sponsorship in 10 days, but they're not willing to rush, so I'm essentially eating that cost while they dilly dally.

But the market is so crap and I don't have much experience so I feel I have to take it. Any advice would be super welcome.

1nolsqw,How do I get anywhere? Should I really make my summer internships look like full year long positions??,"TLDR: New grad with bad resume but no way to improve it realistically, it seems impossible to make ""good projects"" with massive impressive metrics and extremely hard problems to solve

It feels like I'm just spinning in circles going nowhere, I've been applying to places but it always feels like throwing my resume into a bunch of black holes. It's been several weeks (nothing real between my last posts here and now) since the last actual phone call for a real role (outside of the scams / sketchy bootcamps that are obviously not useful to go through).

[resume link](https://imgur.com/a/U7XMsK2)

I think the problem is that there are no flashy metrics or impact I can throw around, but I just don't have any of those. I also don't have any other random frameworks to throw on there that matter. (absolutely nobody cares about how well I can use the Zoom API or random proprietary formats and languages or random package managers I never do fancy things with). My parents think I should be reducing things down to one bullet point per thing and also combining the summer internships with that one company into one thing for 4 years, but that just feels like an obvious lie and it also makes it look worse? Do I really have to lie like I have actual 4 continuous years of experience for an entry level role??? It just feels like so obvious of a lie that I would get nothing at all (""it says his graduation year is 2024 but he has experience from 2021 - 2024 continuously, obviously one of them is a complete lie"")

The other problem is that a background check would expose that lie as something extremely egregiously wrong (what I have now is fine because they probably don't care that much that I don't give them the exact dates for everything, but I think they won't let it slide if I say I worked continuously from may 2021 to august 2024)

I'm also getting nowhere with projects, nothing I do is particularly impressive. I'm not solving problems that haven't been solved before, they probably don't get impressed by the time I hunted down stuff in assembly to make the enemy health value use a bigger data type because that isn't that impressive. I also don't have any good ""result"" for all those STAR format questions they want beyond stuff like ""it worked"" or ""I completed the user story"" when they really want to hear ""I saved the company from certain financial ruin"" or ""I made the company 1 million dollars"".

Should I really make my summer internships look like full year long positions?? TLDR: New grad with bad resume but no way to improve it realistically, it seems impossible to make ""good projects"" with massive impressive metrics and extremely hard problems to solve

It feels like I'm just spinning in circles going nowhere, I've been applying to places but it always feels like throwing my resume into a bunch of black holes. It's been several weeks (nothing real between my last posts here and now) since the last actual phone call for a real role (outside of the scams / sketchy bootcamps that are obviously not useful to go through).

[resume link](https://imgur.com/a/U7XMsK2)

I think the problem is that there are no flashy metrics or impact I can throw around, but I just don't have any of those. I also don't have any other random frameworks to throw on there that matter. (absolutely nobody cares about how well I can use the Zoom API or random proprietary formats and languages or random package managers I never do fancy things with). My parents think I should be reducing things down to one bullet point per thing and also combining the summer internships with that one company into one thing for 4 years, but that just feels like an obvious lie and it also makes it look worse? Do I really have to lie like I have actual 4 continuous years of experience for an entry level role??? It just feels like so obvious of a lie that I would get nothing at all (""it says his graduation year is 2024 but he has experience from 2021 - 2024 continuously, obviously one of them is a complete lie"")

The other problem is that a background check would expose that lie as something extremely egregiously wrong (what I have now is fine because they probably don't care that much that I don't give them the exact dates for everything, but I think they won't let it slide if I say I worked continuously from may 2021 to august 2024)

I'm also getting nowhere with projects, nothing I do is particularly impressive. I'm not solving problems that haven't been solved before, they probably don't get impressed by the time I hunted down stuff in assembly to make the enemy health value use a bigger data type because that isn't that impressive. I also don't have any good ""result"" for all those STAR format questions they want beyond stuff like ""it worked"" or ""I completed the user story"" when they really want to hear ""I saved the company from certain financial ruin"" or ""I made the company 1 million dollars"".

1noegv1,3rd year tier 3 college student-Doing leeetcode+aws. What else to focus on?,"
Hi everyone,
I’m in my 3rd year at a tier 3 college and right now my focus is mainly on:

LeetCode/DSA (for placements)

AWS (just studying, not hands-on yet)

I’m a bit lost on what else I should do right now to improve my chances for a good future (placements/internships/higher opportunities).

Should I be:

Building personal projects (and if yes, what kind of projects add the most value + how do I start)?

Working on open-source contributions (and how does a beginner get into it)?

Strengthening core CS subjects like OS, DBMS, CN (and what’s the best way to approach them)?

Looking for small internships/freelance gigs now (and where to find them)?

Basically, I want concrete advice on what to focus on and how to do it step by step.

1nny2gy,How to demonstrate cybersecurity and cti skills?,"How to demonstrate cybersecurity and cti skills?

Hi everyone,

First of all: let me preface this by saying that I used AI to help me write this post, since English is not my first language.

I'm a 30-year-old male interested in transitioning from a web developer role to a cyber threat intelligence analyst. My background is quite varied and, in some ways, a bit chaotic:

- I earned a degree in political science in 2020.

- I've been self-studying programming since 2020.

- I work as a Python web developer in the ERP sector.

I'm interested in many things in the world of IT—for example, I've self-studied by following Nand2Tetris and CS50AI. In particular, I'm focusing on cyber threat intelligence and cybersecurity because I believe they could be a meeting point between my academic and professional paths.

I've seen various learning resources recommended here (like the guides on Medium by Katie Nickels and Andy Piazza, or even ArcX courses). Currently, I plan to read ""Visual Threat Intelligence"" by Thomas Roccia and use various resources like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, etc. I'm also enrolled in a cybersecurity program at my university (I'm European), though its focus is more on governance than technical aspects.

I'm wondering, when I start looking for a job in CTI, which particularly interests me, how can I demonstrate my skills to a potential employer? I've never worked in a SOC and I come from a quite different world. What types of projects can I do on my own or with others in my free time to demonstrate competence in the field? For example, CTFs, writing blog articles, or something else? Since I know how to program, I was thinking about developing and deploying a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), but I'm not sure if that makes sense.

Previous post^

So, my new manager (my third one) made me send an email after every sprint saying how much carry over is made, any defects made, and how many questions I ask. I’ve never caused carry over or an immediate defect since joining the team so I had no problem, and I send every question I ask since my tech lead keeps telling him I’m not technically independent.

After two sprints, my manager was like “yeah I don’t have anything to say about this, I’ll look into what you can do to get to exceeding expectations. Make sure you’re more vocal about your accomplishments from here on out.”

So just like that, I went from being underperforming and on the verge of being let go for 7 months straight to doing fine. I guess my tech lead was overwhelming him with so much negative feedback that he thought “man, this guy must be having people straight up coding for him every sprint.” Absolutely not. My work is my own work. I never caused carry over. I do not have people code for me. I ask for help by saying what I tried first. 

But this whole experience has really made me feel stressed and unstable in this position. I’m doing the work load of a senior developer with one year of experience currently, and my tech lead wants me to do that while approving pr’s (no problem) while fixing random problems with the application( problem) , while volunteering for extra work (beyond what I can do). And if I say a “bad question” this guy goes straight to my manager. What is a bad question? Whatever pisses him off after his boss gets done yelling at him apparently. 

Edit: oh yea, and I do technically have autofilled, easy placeholder goals. New manager didn’t know and i didn’t know, but I have performance goals like “say how you upheld company values”

And what I get another manager? What if he isn’t a good one and just believes whatever my tech lead says? What if, while doing my senior developer workload, I end up carrying over ONE user story(now my tech lead actually has an excuse to get me fired, my manager will be the first person he messages.) 

And yes, I am going to apply for more jobs, but I’m also not vested(employer contributions to my 401k aren’t settled) until I hit the two year mark. That’s a little bit away. But this has all left me with so many questions.

Is this normal? 

What just happened? 

Should I go all in on applying for other jobs? 

Should I wait to vest? 

Do you think I’ll get fired before I vest?

1nnwoua,"Graduated from CS in April, enrolled in Engineering, planning to do coding bootcamp and get eng internship in May 2026","Hello. I am looking for advice. I graduated from CS in April. I looked from January 2024 to August 2024 for an internship, had about 11 interviews, 7 for software development, but didn’t get any offer. I became demotivated and made the mistake of not looking for a job since graduation because I assumed that finding a full time job was harder than finding an internship. 

I enrolled in Engineering a week ago because I watched all of the Computer Engineering graduates get jobs at the best companies while less than half of my internship cohort found an internship and computer engineering graduates make substantially more money, about 1.08x more, according to the 2021 Canadian census, and are 40% more likely to work in software. The engineering program here requires 4 mandatory 4 month internships to graduate and up to 6 internships. 

I am taking 1st year physics and chemistry and engineering courses right now, I am planning to start a coding bootcamp soon and start looking for a 4 month engineering internship in January that will start in May hopefully in software. I am hoping to get a full time offer from my internship. Is this a good idea? Or Should I just drop out and look hard for a full time job?

I am looking for advice. I graduated from CS in April. I looked from January 2024 to August 2024 for an internship, had about 11 interviews, 7 for software development, but didn’t get any offer. I became demotivated and made the mistake of not looking for a job since graduation because I assumed that finding a full time job was harder than finding an internship. 

I enrolled in Engineering a week ago because I watched all of the Computer Engineering graduates get jobs at the best companies while less than half of my internship cohort found an internship and computer engineering graduates make substantially more money, about 1.08x more, according to the 2021 Canadian census, and are 40% more likely to work in software. The engineering program here requires 4 mandatory 4 month internships to graduate and up to 6 internships. 

I am taking 1st year physics and chemistry and engineering courses right now, I am planning to start a coding bootcamp soon and start looking for a 4 month engineering internship in January that will start in May hopefully in software. I am hoping to get a full time offer from my internship. Is this a good idea? Or Should I just drop out and look hard for a full time job?

1nnv9ik,"Don't worry, the job market is just fine","It is the excat same as it was on 2020 in the tech field. Same complaints about spending over a year with resume revisions, over 1000 applications and a handful of humiliating interviews. Well... it was always like this. 

It was exactly what happened to me around 2019-21. Finished collage (being 33) and looked for a job every day, all day for over a year. Failed in coding interviews and got ghosted multiple times. 

It was difficult then and its difficult today. 
Why? Not because the job market is bad and not because of AI. 

It's simply because it's a competitive field, and like in any other 6 figure positions (unless you're connected) it can take a long while until you land a job. 

Today I'm considered mid-level and I get the same number of interview requests I got back then. 

(SOC Analyst, 130k)

It was exactly what happened to me around 2019-21. Finished collage (being 33) and looked for a job every day, all day for over a year. Failed in coding interviews and got ghosted multiple times. 

It was difficult then and its difficult today. 
Why? Not because the job market is bad and not because of AI. 

It's simply because it's a competitive field, and like in any other 6 figure positions (unless you're connected) it can take a long while until you land a job. 

Today I'm considered mid-level and I get the same number of interview requests I got back then.

I have some internship experience, but from joke roles where I barely do anything (and barely get paid anything). The people there (and my friends) say I do good, but I don't think so. My resume has been reviewed and I'm told it looks excellent, but I feel like I blow up a lot of it and that the whole thing is this shitty cardboard Potemkin village set that'll just collapse with one nudge. Some of my resume stuff is literally just stupid ChatGPT stuff. I feel like I'm likely to fail any technical interview or OA I'm given, and while I'm actively trying to correct this, I think it's genuinely too little too late. I can barely remember a lot of the stuff I've learned a few years ago (including pre-GPT). I believe if I were where I currently am but 1 year ago, I'd actually be really cracked and have better success with internships, but now it's too late to apply to most of those.

I'm realistic about my goals and don't expect to ever break into FAANG or anything of that tier in my lifetime. I knew I wasn't FAANG material since high school. But all I want is to be able to live on my own away from my shitty Asian parents. I've applied to tech roles at non-tech companies, SWE-adjacent roles rather than pure SWE, etc. On average I'm speaking with one real human per month, but as I move into full-time recruitment rather than intern recruitment, I notice signs of this slowing.

I feel average no matter what I do. And in this job market, you cannot be average. I feel gravely ashamed of myself for being so average when I was smart in elementary school. (Long story but I got kicked out of middle school, which could explain my inability to succeed or be ""at the top of the pack""). In many ways I honestly regret even majoring in CS, but I concede many other fields, e.g. the hard sciences, might've been even worse choices for me, and had I chosen those I wouldn't likely even have semi-stellar grades to brag about. And since I'm so far ahead in the game, it's literally too late to even do so. Plus my parents refuse to pay beyond 4 years of tuition and think delaying graduation is stupid (and to be honest they're probably right). When I suggested pivoting to nursing or the trades, they just laughed in my face over how poorly I'd do in those jobs (and again, they're right, I genuinely am physically weak and would struggle in those roles).

If things don't get better by next summer after I graduate, I honestly wonder if I should just spend all of my money on bus tickets to some random city in the Midwest and live on the street there. Maybe blow the rest on lottery tickets since at this point there's almost no difference. Sure beats having to shuttle to and from my crummy parents' house. I sometimes wish I could turn back time and obey my parents more so I wouldn't be in this situation, but then I realize even that wouldn't have helped.

I know that ideally, this year I should be going crazy with everything, but at this point I'm saddled with so many course and other responsibilities (including some dismaying parental conflicts) that I think there's a genuine possibility that my grades could even plummet below 3.6 GPA. Also, my parents are also begging me to consider a Master's, but I really don't even know if I should do so - what if even with a Master's I fail?

1nmllw2,"Architect turned software engineer, feel stuck","I’ve been working for 10 years as a software engineer and I feel stuck. 

I have a degree in architecture (but never worked as an architect) and I did 3d art professionally for almost 15 years prior to making the switch.

I was basically aiming to become a technical artist by adding some coding skills, but overshot it, first becoming a “creative technologist” and then landing a software engineering role. 
Since then, I worked exclusively for startups, most of which folded. By the time I realized I should have been applying for big companies, the layoffs started happening. 

Most of my roles revolved around WebGL which feels like a really weird niche. I don’t really consider myself a graphics engineer, but I do work a lot with shaders, GPGPU stuff, can read some whitepapers and such. I have some vague understanding of how GPUs work, but not enough to understand cache coherence, never worked with geometry shaders etc. WebGL felt like a path of least resistance - there’s no need to understand compute shaders when they don’t exist. Also, what these “cloud viewers” need, usually isn’t that advanced, one can get a lot of mileage by just knowing how to write shaders and understanding what draw calls are. 

So instead of growing in that direction and trying to become a bonafide graphics engineer, I thought that it would be easier and better to become a front end engineer that has some graphics chops.

I’m not entirely sure if I succeed at this. I’ve had a job where I was mentoring people on react and typescript in addition to doing graphics, was making architecture decisions and such. I’ve had one where I made a Final Cut Pro clone with react. But ive also had some where I’d get laid off once the graphics need was gone, and there were other dedicated FE engineers. 

I think because 3D meshes may feel alien to a backend/full stack engineer, i ended up doing some computational geometry as well. But again like WebGL, what I did felt amateurish - it did the job, but was typescript, not c++ or rust. Sometimes it would run in the browser, sometimes in node, but far from using something like open cascade. As in, I wasn’t able to combine mature systems in a serious language. But I was able to implement my own half edges, quadtree and such, surgically, to solve a problem. 

I’d grind leetcode and do well in interviews, which is how I landed my best jobs, but this seems like it’s over now. I did poorly at an AI interview earlier this year. 

Obviously this is all IC type of stuff, which I do like, but I’ve been exposed to different management styles. Some times it was a free for all, no code reviews, anyone can nuke the master branch, no standup, no retro, just me and my CEO sitting side by side, while our CTO is missing in action. Other times it was really anal agile for the sake of being agile. My favorite situation was when a place that lacked structure got a very good technical program manager. She introduced processes gradually, each time outlining what we were struggling with and then offering a solution. This got me interested in management in general, but I wasn’t able to really pick up much. I worked with some engineers who transitioned to managers, and they were just way more on top of these things. Worked with some that remained ICs but were still super organized. 



I am lucky to be employed atm and I actually really like my job. If all goes well I may just get unstuck on my own. But having been through the grinder, and since this is another startup, I may be back to where I started. 


So, what can I do to be employable in the next ten years, even better, to thrive?


If I were to leverage my architectural background, how could I do that? By far the two shittiest jobs that I had were in two construction tech startups. I’m still not sure what happened there, I thought I’d bring some domain knowledge to the table, in addition to useful coding skills, it didn’t happen. 

Is there anything that the 3d art is good for? I feel like the ship for this has sailed 10 years ago. I had a massive imposter syndrome after my first creative technologist job. I did not reach out to my bosses friend who worked at META, and instead bent over backwards to land a job as a FE engineer. I recently saw a talk by this lady who was a UX designer there, where she says how she has no idea how she got hired there in the first place as a graphics designer. 10 years ago I met a person at a hackathon in SF, same profile - a 3d artist looking to break into tech. I don’t think they ever became a software engineer, but maybe even better - a VR evangelist for Mozilla.

How could I utilize this if at all? Go “by the way, I have an eye for color and composition”? “I can speak the same language as both your 3d artists and your engineers”? Who am I even trying to convince here, a 20yo CEO probably doesn’t care about some 3d renderings from 20 years ago no matter how good they were for the time?

Maybe just pick up figma and say “look I do UX/UI too”?


If I were to put all my money on the IC path, what should I focus on? More graphics? More web (full stack)? Try to become an expert on rust?


What about going back to school, what field would even make sense?

Need some advice here. I’ve got offers from both EY GDS and Infosys, both for the Hyderabad location(India). I have about 7.5 years of experience in tech consulting.

Fixed pay is the same at both.

Infosys has ~15% variable, EY GDS ~10% variable.


Money-wise it’s not a huge difference, but I’m trying to figure out which would be better in terms of growth, work culture, and long-term career path.

1nmr5l0,Use a framework for a side project that you do not enjoy just to increase hiring chances?,"I'm a FE Engineer with 9 YOE, with around 6-7 of them with Vue for the past years. I did some basic React things early in my career (and I'm generally aware how many things have changed).

I know that it's a matter of taste, but I personally find Vue much more enjoyable to work with. I am aware that the job market has always preferred React, yet both of my last two jobs with Vue were still not that difficult to land.

Lately I've had the desire to start a side project that I plan to monetize. It will probably fail and I might not finish it, but my aim is to make it production ready and at least try to get users, and just at least try. However, I really struggle with having energy to work on something on the side after my full-time job, but my idea might actually yield some income and worst case scenario, it might be make my profile a little bit more attractive.

As you all know, the job market is in the gutter now. In order to make myself more attractive for potential jobs in the future, I thought about combining the idea of the side project with gathering some experience with React. Two birds with one stone and all. However, I really do not enjoy using React.

It's said that Vue and React are not *that* different, especially now with Vue 3 and the composition API. But I think they still diverge quite a bit. A good employer will also not mind one's background, it's all JS in the end. However, the job market is so bad, that if the job's stack is React and its between me and a 100 other people having React skills, they will take another candidate hands down. And in my experience, only maybe about 20% of job ads might require Vue.

So, should I push through with my side project and try to use React, even if it will be really hard for me to find time and motivation for it, or should I use Vue and make the experience a bit more enjoyable and faster that way?

I guess there's no right or wrong answer, but I wanted to hear your opinions or maybe even relatable experiences.",3,0.67,8,2025-09-21 15:51:59,Kotoriii,Experienced,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nmr5l0/use_a_framework_for_a_side_project_that_you_do/,True,0,False,False,15,Sunday,2025-09-21,2025-09,2.0,5.36,"Use a framework for a side project that you do not enjoy just to increase hiring chances?

Java: I've worked with this on and off for a number of years, ironically always with spring framework, know it decently well in terms of usage, would need to brush up on multithreading/concurrency, have used SpringThreadExecutor in the past for big batch jobs.  I would say I know this language 8/10

Golang: I've used this on and off too but not as much or as deeply as Java usually in a microservice context and didn't do any concurrent programming with it but does look a lot nice to work with in that context than the others. It's been sometime since I used this.  I would say I know this language 5/10

PHP: I used this for a couple of years as old job had a monolith, I actually didn't mind this language and was really easy to pick up, no concurrency or like just a straight crud app with a LAMP stack. I would say I know this language 5/10

Python: Used for some scripts, Advent of Code and leetcode job interview questions fun way to use and nice that its closest to pseudo code yeah spacing can be annoying but overall, I liked it. I would say I know this language 5 maybe 6/10

JavaScript: Used it for a couple of years from what i remember it was promise chain hell, have done some stuff with it recently on a full stack node.js app but it has so much crap on top I am not a fan, I tend to almost write Java like code in Javascript. I would say I know this language 3/10

  
I really want to get a deeper knowledge of one of these languages and make it my main one, I feel almost a tie between C/Python/Golang.   
  
C for just sheer simplicity I'm sure it will be segfaults out the ass in the beginning but would be fun to get that low level and just be me talking to the computer's memory, then again it may break me. Could open opportunities for hardware or os programming.

Python I feel fast and free with this language, just having to remember at times when func params are copied etc. Fast to work with but many others have called it slow, also nice that it's the default language of AI so very versatile.  
  
Golang easier use of pointers and mem management, simplified concurrency programming, I haven't done much beyond crud so hard to know just how efficient this language could be if I go a little deeper. Also seems that lots of jobs openings.

Sorry if this post is a little rambley I'm just out of work and wanting to enjoy programming again for fun, so just thinking aloud. If you made it this far thank you would love to hear your opinions/takes and even fun projects within each language?

1nmr36x,Advice needed: Move directly into Data Science/Machine Learning engineering or build engineering experience in a Data Engineering role first?,"**Context:** I finished a bachelors in Software Engineering, after that worked for a year as a Data scientist/Data engineer and did a double master in AI and Data science. Now I am applying for jobs for Data engineer/Data Scienitst/Machine Learning Engineer. I did two internships, one for my bachelors thesis and one for my master thesis. Both lasted 7 and 8 months respectively.

**My Observations:** During my application process I notice that i am predominantly getting interviews for Data Engineering positions since DS and MLE positions are mostly medior and the latter being honestly more of a senior role (I noticed). I did get some DS and MLE interviews but they almost always went to more experienced people. But I have 2-3 more ongoing for both DS and MLE positions.

**My question**: Is going into Data engineering a better move to become a better rounded Data Scientist/Machine Leanring engineer with a strong fundamental understanding of data flows, engineering principles and DevOps experience? 

  
**Elaboration on my question:** What I notice is that Data scientists know nothing of good engineering principles and just work in Juypter notebooks. I come from a software engineering background first, so I appreciate clean/OOP code that is well documented etc. Further, developing these skills in a Data engineering role for a few years I think is the better move than directly going into Data Science or Machine Learning Engineering. Since you build up a strong understanding of how data flows through an enterprise and how data is used and how solutions are deployed, which will be more useful in the long run and makes you a more valuable candidate when applyin for DS or MLE positions in the future.

**Experience during interviews:** When I go to my first interviews at companies/organizations they are always excited about my DS and AI background (when I pitch my experience and ambitions correctly) when it's a Data engineering position. Usually with the bigger, older organizations they have ideas for AI in the pipelines but they are working towards it. So I pitch myself as someone who wants to learn a lot in the Data engineering position to build strong  fundamental engineering principles. When the time arises that AI projects are being spun up I will immediately be available internally to work on these projects (usually they have concrete plans to move towards AI projects within a year or two). I'll be familiar with the internal process and data and I keep up to date with the latest interesting developments in AI by reading papers, watching prominent youtube channels etc. This makes me, in my opinions, a very strong candidate since all parties I talk to have AI in their pipelines.

**Reason for this question:** Next week I'll be having multiple second interviews where I meet the team and talk more technically and see if I am a fit for the team. I have a good chance of gettng an offer next week or the week there after I believe (I am always reluctant to say this, I don't want to jinx myself) and these positions are all Data engineering positions. So I found this a good time to ask the question since I have some real opportunities here.

But here's the problem, sometimes I go on YT or Instagram and see influencers saying that the CS job market is allegedly in shambles (atleast in the US) and that worries me a lot because what if I'm unable to get a job.

Anyways, once I do get into CS, my plan is to explore my options and see which area I want to specialize in but for now, a Masters in AI or Quantum Computing (does CS even allow me to do a masters in QC?) are the ones in my mind. And then possibly even a PhD.

But here's the problem, sometimes I go on YT or Instagram and see influencers saying that the CS job market is allegedly in shambles (atleast in the US) and that worries me a lot because what if I'm unable to get a job. So I'd like to know whether a Bachelors in CS and then specializing further are even worth it.


TL;DR: Is it worth pursuing an undergraduate CS degree and then a masters in a specific area (AI or QC in mind rn) with the possibility of even a PhD?",39,981,1021,0.037,0.869,0.094,0.8051,Positive,False,False,False

1nmnu77,"Artist considering switching to Flutter/Dart, is mobile dev a stable career?","Hi everyone,

I’m 22 and currently at a crossroads in life. My true passion has always been art — I’ve been into 3D, design, animation, and even tried going down the video game path. But reality has hit me hard: the competition is insane, pay seems unstable (especially in my region), and the career ladder feels very uncertain.

Because of this, I feel compelled to shift toward something more stable that can actually pay the bills. That’s where programming comes in, so I do have some basic foundation, but I’m far from a “genius coder.” I see myself as an average person just trying to learn a skill and build a solid career.

Lately, I’ve been drawn to Dart + Flutter. My idea is to become a mobile developer and hopefully land a stable office job making apps. I even found Angela Yu’s “Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart” on Udemy and thought about starting there.

But I have some doubts:

* I keep hearing that mobile development is a “dead end” after 5–10 years, that you just build UI and don’t grow much.
* Some say you eventually have to get into backend, full-stack, or management (whatever that means)
* Others claim Flutter is too new and risky compared to native Android/iOS.

My questions are:

1. Is mobile dev (especially Flutter) still a good career path in 2025 and beyond?
2. Can someone like me (coming from an art background) realistically make a stable living as a Flutter developer?
3. What does long-term growth look like for mobile devs? Are there other people like me in the industry?
4. Would you recommend starting with Flutter or something else if stability is the main goal?

I’m not chasing quick money. I just want a career that’s realistic, stable, and allows me to keep improving over time.

Would love to hear honest input from people already working in the field 🙏",0,0.43,12,2025-09-21 12:47:42,Mohammadbashir007,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nmnu77/artist_considering_switching_to_flutterdart_is/,True,0,False,False,12,Sunday,2025-09-21,2025-09,12.0,5.16,"Artist considering switching to Flutter/Dart, is mobile dev a stable career?

1nmh7t1,How to list intent for master's as a graduating senior applying to internships,"Hi all,

I'm a current third-year in university but intending to graduate this year (in three rather than four years) - over this past summer I worked at a certain FAANG company and got inclined for full-time (essentially not a guaranteed return offer but will most likely receive one once headcount is finalized, however far in the future that is).

I was planning to continue applying for this next summer internship cycle at different companies and locations that I'd prefer to work at and pursue a combined BS/MS at my current school the next year which I haven't yet applied to (4+1 program, or in my case 3+1), and return to the full-time position otherwise if I don't end up finding anything. I understand that admission to these programs is higher but not guaranteed, but was wondering how to list the intent to return to school after my undergraduate, as my graduation date is currently listed as what it would be for new grad positions on my resume, which I think might be affecting my chance at internship positions.

Another option would just be to lie about my undergrad graduation date to be later than it actually is, or just push back my graduation a semester as I'm taking a larger course load than normal at the moment, but just trying to figure out what the best course of action is.

* The bar feels low compared to larger tech companies like Amazon; the team is fine with high latencies and error rates.

1nkwrgg,Switching to contracting was the best decision I've ever made.,"After my last layoff from a full time job, I decided for the first time to actually stop ignoring the recruiters messaging me about W2 contract roles and actually see what it's about. I ended up getting a role through one of the major firms in tech. I'm now 2 years in after a few renewals, and oh my god, I didn't know what I was missing.

It's probably just because of the type of person I am. I hate ""team building"" bullshit and people who treat work like a social club. I want to be left alone so I can do my work, though I'm good at working as part of a team and collaborating when needed. But work is work to me, I don't want to be friends and get together for a beer.

I don't have to go a bunch of the company meetings and townhalls. I don't have to meet with a manager each quarter to discuss my ""career goals"" because nobody cares. I just get my work, do it, and get my weekly paycheck that is significantly higher than my full time pay was, even accounting for paying for the insurance I get through the firm. Nobody cares when I clock in and out, as long as I get my work done. There's no less job security than there was at my full time roles where rounds of layoffs would come every year at least.

This is the only job I've ever had where I am not constantly bombarded with a bunch of ""extracurricular"" bullshit that eats away at my soul and burns me out.

Oh yeah, perhaps most importantly: **I got the job after two interviews: a phone screen with HR and a technical discussion with my team, with no leetcode or DSA interrogation rounds.** Just a discussion of my projects and experience. 

I have friends who have been doing this for years and they have similar experiences to me. I feel dumb for not having tried it sooner, because I bought into the idea that it was ""lesser"" or was afraid I wouldn't have good enough health insurance.

1nlytgm,How should I pitch this to my CEO?,"
So here’s the situation:
I was the first employees in the startup, have 2 yoe.
We hired a team lead 3 months ago, but the MVP is still delayed because of poor planning, prioritization, and follow-up.

The CEO now wants to replace him.


My thought: at this stage, onboarding someone new would waste at least a couple of weeks. The value of a team lead is mostly in the early architecture phase, but the architecture is already in place. What we really need now is:

1. Code reviews (already handled internally)


2. Daily stand-ups and sprint management


3. Sprint planning and retrospectives

I’ve already been doing parts of this (following up with teammates, raising bottlenecks, and aligning tasks). My plan is to suggest to the CEO:

Don’t hire a new lead right now, let the current team handle things internally.

I’ll take initiative to cover stand-ups, retros, and sprint planning.

If after a sprint the LLM feature still doesn’t improve (our most critical deliverable), then we can think about allocating another dev for this as the current dev is having difficulty delivering a stable version.

An architect doesn't build a skyscraper in a month and then spend the next 100 years working constantly to fix all of its little issues. They build it slowly and deliberately over years, then finally walk away with a building that will last centuries with minimal needs for maintenance.

The company that I work at, however, seems to care primarily about speed of delivery. Even as a newer dev, I have found many small mistakes in the codebase. Anything from typos, to incorrect log messages, to unecessary extra methods, and other general messiness. I have seen gigantic, multiple-hundred-line methods. I work at a FAANG, so the quality isn't *awful*, but I think it could definitely be better.

  
I find myself scratching my head, because my team constantly has a backlog of issues to fix. On-calls are usually quite heavy. I wonder why this should be the case?

The company that I work at, however, seems to care primarily about speed of delivery. Even as a newer dev, I have found many small mistakes in the codebase. Anything from typos, to incorrect log messages, to unecessary extra methods, and other general messiness. I have seen gigantic, multiple-hundred-line methods. I work at a FAANG, so the quality isn't *awful*, but I think it could definitely be better.

  
I find myself scratching my head, because my team constantly has a backlog of issues to fix. On-calls are usually quite heavy. I wonder why this should be the case? 

  
Why don't these companies focus on building slowly and deliberately, rather than slapping together things quickly (and then needing to tweak and maintain them for years/ decades)?

  
As someone who prefers slow, deliberate quality, is this the wrong field for me?",78,1323,1402,0.025,0.92,0.054,0.6966,Positive,False,False,False

I would be leaving my SQL Analyst role which is very comfortable, good WLB, and has good benefits that I won’t be getting as a contractor.

1nl8jwd,AWS Offer vs Current Company (Startup),"Hello, 

I realize I might get clowned for asking this, but I do genuinely think hearing peoples' perspectives will help me.

I have been working as a Software Engineer at a relatively large (for a startup) startup for 3 years now (was 22 then, am 25 now). I work on pretty low-levelled stuff with C, like Linux kernel stuff, network stuff, etc. I started as an intern right out of college making $25 an hour, but gradually moved up each year to $140,000 per year which I make now.

My team is really chill overall, and I am good friends with a good-sized portion of the team members. I do think that I have learned a lot already throughout my \~3 years at my current role, but I know I could still learn more here if I stayed. But it would have to come from myself searching out new opportunities actively within the organization, as the work I have been getting has been kind of the same for a while, and I do feel kind of monotonous at times. However, I also fault myself for not being more proactive and asking my boss for more interesting work, I realize I've been kind of just doing whatever they needed me to do, without advocating to be given what I think would be most interesting/ best for my learning. Lastly I should mention that I do lots of work with an overseas team so sometimes I have to do late night meetings and stuff which is not exactly preferable (though I'm sure that's not necessarily something that is avoidable, and might happen at any other job).

The situation I am in is, I have just received an offer from AWS as an SDE II, at around \~$330,000 total compensation. I wasn't really seeking it out, I just got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, and thought I'd give it a shot and see how the interview process went. And then, yeah I just kind of Forrest Gump'd to an offer. So yeah it all kind of happened sort of fast for me, so I have mixed emotions. Obviously, the money is more (though the startup I work at might get acquired, I think we do have potential offers etc., but I am not entirely sure as the management hasn't directly told us). But I am trying to decide what is best for my career. While I love my current team, I do think that I could gain a lot from expanding my horizons. And working at Amazon might also allow me to open new doors. The team I was offered to join is pretty similar to what I am doing now (systems level and network stuff). But I also would potentially have more opportunities to move around within the organization (eventually) and try new things, which is definitely not really possible with my current company. Also I think I might want to try living somewhere else some day (been in the Bay Area really my whole life) and obviously it might be easier to do that if I had other offices at my company I could go to (not really an option at my current company).

  
So I guess I just want to hear what people would do in my shoes, it is surprisingly a little difficult to decide.

I think as I approach 8 years in, advance in my career, and seek more senior roles, this is going to become problematic.

My history looks like this:

* Job 1 left after 1 year 6 months
* Job 2 left after 1 year 7 months
* Job 3 laid off after 1 year 10 months
* Job 4 laid off after 1 year
* Job 5 laid off after 1 year 3 months

Job 3 was Twitter. I would have stayed there indefinitely if it hadn't become a train wreck and I and everyone I knew was let go. Since then each job has been a place I enjoyed but my employer makes the decision for me that me and many others can no longer work there.

On one hand I empathize with the desire for a candidate with longer tenure, but it's starting to feel rigged. I generally get good feedback from my managers and then I'm blindsided by what I assume are decisions made above them. It's a bit slow-going finding a new job after my most recent layoff and I'm wondering how much this might be holding me back. In addition to feeling quite jaded at this point, it feels rigged in the sense the industry has decided that employees are easily disposable and long term hiring decisions are not important, but they also want heavily tenured and battle-hardened engineers.

I tend to get significantly above-average pay packages at these places compared to the industry median (but not necessarily compared to the company) and they have all been remote roles, so I wonder if that puts a target on my back, i.e., ""high-risk high-reward,"" but the last two companies aren't what I'd call ""big tech"". Against my better judgement I've included ""company-wide layoffs"" next to my last three roles because I worry employers might balk otherwise, but I wonder if there's anything else to be done in my situation, and what this all has cost me.",4,0.84,12,2025-09-19 20:11:25,CricketDrop,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nl9eoj/tenure_and_job_hunting_in_an_unstable_career/,True,0,False,False,20,Friday,2025-09-19,2025-09,2.4,10.08,"Tenure and job hunting in an unstable career Has anyone else had job hopping imposed on them by employers?

Clearing up the new H-1B $100K fee rule — doesn’t hit you if you’re already in the U.S.

TL;DR: The $100K fee only applies if you’re outside the U.S. on H-1B and trying to come in. If you’re already here and just doing an extension, amendment, or transfer, this doesn’t apply.

A lot of people have been confused after the Sept 19, 2025 White House proclamation (“Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers”), so here’s the gist:

The fee is tied to entry — it applies when an employer files for someone who’s abroad and needs to come into the U.S.

The text literally says it’s for “aliens who are outside the United States” and seeking entry.

If you’re already in the U.S. on H-1B or F1 or OPT, and your company files for an extension or transfer, there’s no $100K fee involved.

The only catch: if you leave the U.S. and try to come back after Sept 21, 2025, that’s when the rule applies.

1nl5e6k,Should I be worried that I’ve been working for the same company for 10 years?,"I’m a Senior Web Developer and I’m approaching my 10 year work anniversary.

This is the only company I have ever worked for. I started on an internship straight out of university and have worked my way up to a Senior Dev position.

I like my job and the company. I get along well with my colleagues. The pay and benefits are excellent. And I’m passionate to the project because I have seen it mature over time.

The company has grown a lot since I joined. It was small when I started, with just myslef and two other developers in our team. We had to do everything ourselves. Without a product team or QA team. The company didn't even have a dedicated IT department so basically had to do that too!

Things have changed a lot since then. We have grown to an enterprise level business. We have multiple engineering, product, QA and support teams - about 50 people in total. Business is good and we are showing no signs of slowing down.

Despite working at the same company for so long, it doesn’t feel like it. I don’t feel stuck in the same environment as we have moved offices multiple times. And I have worked with lots of different colleagues as old members leave and new people join. The job I had 10 years ago is vastly different from my current role.

Honestly I would be happy staying with this company until I retire, But I know that is not a healthy mindset. Good things don’t last forever, and I am aware I may need to look for a new job someday.

I am concerned that having stayed with the same company for so long will be a detriment to me. When looking for a new job, my CV (resume) will be sparse. I wouldn't know how to anwser uncomfortable questions in interviews, like “why did I stay at the same company for so long?” and “what other projects have I worked on?”

The truth is, I haven’t worked on any other projects. I only know one tech stack because that is all I have ever been exposed to. I would be completely lost if I had to work on a different project.

I often feel like an imposter. I am not skilled or experienced enough to be a senior dev. My colleagues often discuss technology and patterns I’m unfamiliar with and I don't feel I can contribute any useful knoweldge.

I believe my long experience with the project and company is the only reason for my promotion. People rely on me to explain parts of the codebase or obscure business logic because I’m the only one who has been around long enough to know the reasoning of the original implementation. This is great for this project, but it’s not a transferable skill. At a new company I’d be starting entirely from scratch, and that scares me!

Would it be better for me to start looking for a new job now? Or should I make the most of it and hang on in my current role for as long as I can?",0,0.44,10,2025-09-19 17:40:20,YetAnotherInterneter,Experienced,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nl5e6k/should_i_be_worried_that_ive_been_working_for_the/,True,0,False,False,17,Friday,2025-09-19,2025-09,10.0,4.4,"Should I be worried that I’ve been working for the same company for 10 years?

I like my job and the company. I get along well with my colleagues. The pay and benefits are excellent. And I’m passionate to the project because I have seen it mature over time.

The company has grown a lot since I joined. It was small when I started, with just myslef and two other developers in our team. We had to do everything ourselves. Without a product team or QA team. The company didn't even have a dedicated IT department so basically had to do that too!

Things have changed a lot since then. We have grown to an enterprise level business. We have multiple engineering, product, QA and support teams - about 50 people in total. Business is good and we are showing no signs of slowing down.

Despite working at the same company for so long, it doesn’t feel like it. I don’t feel stuck in the same environment as we have moved offices multiple times. And I have worked with lots of different colleagues as old members leave and new people join. The job I had 10 years ago is vastly different from my current role.

Honestly I would be happy staying with this company until I retire, But I know that is not a healthy mindset. Good things don’t last forever, and I am aware I may need to look for a new job someday.

I am concerned that having stayed with the same company for so long will be a detriment to me. When looking for a new job, my CV (resume) will be sparse. I wouldn't know how to anwser uncomfortable questions in interviews, like “why did I stay at the same company for so long?” and “what other projects have I worked on?”

The truth is, I haven’t worked on any other projects. I only know one tech stack because that is all I have ever been exposed to. I would be completely lost if I had to work on a different project.

I often feel like an imposter. I am not skilled or experienced enough to be a senior dev. My colleagues often discuss technology and patterns I’m unfamiliar with and I don't feel I can contribute any useful knoweldge.

I believe my long experience with the project and company is the only reason for my promotion. People rely on me to explain parts of the codebase or obscure business logic because I’m the only one who has been around long enough to know the reasoning of the original implementation. This is great for this project, but it’s not a transferable skill. At a new company I’d be starting entirely from scratch, and that scares me!

Would it be better for me to start looking for a new job now? Or should I make the most of it and hang on in my current role for as long as I can?",77,2772,2850,0.049,0.855,0.097,0.9769,Positive,False,False,False
1nl4irl,Break vibe coding habit and prep for a job hop in a year,"I’m a SWE with ~2.5 YOE in Ohio at a decent sized company and my current job is light on focused coding. I mostly do small bug fixes, Linux bring-up for new tech, adding kernel modules, and a lot of documentation. On top of that, I get thrown around between different projects, so I rarely get to focus deeply on one thing, and there’s a lot more I could list.

Because of that, I can read code decently well but I struggle to write from scratch. I’ve picked up a bad “vibe coding” habit and want to break it. My core CS knowledge is rusty since I haven’t really used it since college about three years ago. My managers like my problem-solving and critical thinking, but I feel underprepared for technical interviews. My main experience is Python, C++ and JavaScript though I don’t feel proficient in any at all.

My goal is to job hop in a year into a stable SWE role in Columbus, OH. I really don’t have a preference on what type of company so I rather be general when prepping. I’m thinking of learning Python first since I think I can get proficient faster than C++, but I’m not tied to a single path. I’ve thought about CS50x, CS50P, the Helsinki Python MOOC, or something on Udemy, but another thought I have is whether I should just go straight into LeetCode and build from there.

TL;DR: Currently a SWE at ~2.5 YOE at a decent sized company. My current job is scattered across bug fixes, Linux bring-up, docs, kernel modules, and constantly being switched between projects, so I never get deep focus.

1nkmmmo,Should I push to become Technical Project Manager instead of hiring another team lead?,"
I’m a dev who was the first employee in the startup. On our team, we’ve got two other juniors (1 yr each), and two seniors (7 yrs+) but with little social skills and communication issues. Three months ago, we hired a team lead, but the MVP still isn’t delivered because of poor planning, prioritization, and follow-up.

Here’s my thought:
We don’t actually need another “team lead.” We already handle PRs and code reviews internally. What we really need is proper planning, prioritization, and alignment, in other words, a technical project manager.

1nk09zi,Why are companies scared of ambitious people?,"I changed careers at the age of 35 and moved into tech and i am from a third world country. I was fortunate to land a DevOps role at a company that has a very relaxed culture. Nobody really cares whether you are working from the office or from home.

Because I felt I had started a little late, I set clear goals for myself and committed to following them with full focus. The company provides resources for learning, so I used every single one of them. On top of that I bought my own courses, set up AWS accounts, and practiced daily. I even had an old server lying around at home. I spun it up with Ubuntu and started building a homelab on weekends.

Excited about my progress, I shared everything with my boss, hoping for feedback and guidance. Instead of encouragement, I was labeled as “too ambitious” and even considered a flight risk(the very next day HR in a very friendly manner if i am happy working here?). After that conversation, the communication from my boss slowly disappeared.

At first that was disappointing. Then something unexpected happened. I found a mentor here on Reddit. Even though he lives in a different time zone,. He reviews my work, gives me honest suggestions, and the only thing he has asked in return is that I pay it forward when my time comes. That single request has inspired me more than anything else.

My plan is simple. I want to stay where I am for the next three years, collect AWS certifications, and keep building homelabs with different tools. I am not going anywhere. I am a resilient and determined MF, and no lack of support will stop me from learning and growing.

1njxlh1,130k remote vs 170k RTO offer,"After 6 months of navigating this shitty job market I got a fully remote job at a midsized biotech for 130k base salary with no bonus or other comp. I’ve been working here for about a month and a half and its been pretty great; the work-life-balance is nice and the culture so far is chill. My team is developing a brand new product for the company which is pretty exciting, but that also means there’s risks.
The product could flop, maybe the culture shifts once its released and we are supporting client, or maybe the product gets cancelled, i get laid-off, and my resume shows me working on some zero impact project. The work is pure Java with some Vertx.

A recruiter reached out to me about a role i was previously rejected on. Presumably the candidate they chose over me left or something and now the team is willing to give me an offer without redoing the interview process. This is a VERY well known entertainment company and they are offering me a better compensation package:
130k base salary, up to 25% annual RSU, 7% annual bonus, and a 25% sign-on bonus in stock. The title is actually lower since im a senior in my current role, but this is a fullstack position. The team works on a more mature product, but probably less exciting. The work is Springboot Java with a sprinkle of React (idk any frontend so its an upskill opportunity)

I’ve been working here for about a month and a half and its been pretty great; the work-life-balance is nice and the culture so far is chill. My team is developing a brand new product for the company which is pretty exciting, but that also means there’s risks.
The product could flop, maybe the culture shifts once its released and we are supporting client, or maybe the product gets cancelled, i get laid-off, and my resume shows me working on some zero impact project. The work is pure Java with some Vertx.

A recruiter reached out to me about a role i was previously rejected on. Presumably the candidate they chose over me left or something and now the team is willing to give me an offer without redoing the interview process. This is a VERY well known entertainment company and they are offering me a better compensation package:
130k base salary, up to 25% annual RSU, 7% annual bonus, and a 25% sign-on bonus in stock. The title is actually lower since im a senior in my current role, but this is a fullstack position. The team works on a more mature product, but probably less exciting. The work is Springboot Java with a sprinkle of React (idk any frontend so its an upskill opportunity)

1nk5eig,Baby while working?,"Lots of little details here so bear with me. 


Tech lead, 13 YOE, F500, WFH 95% of the time. Only need to go into the office for select VIP meetings. 


I am 9 weeks into ""maternity leave"" (aka 6 weeks to heal from major abdominal surgery plus 6 weeks unpaid leave) and I am getting anxiety about the end of it looming - mostly about dropping off my baby into daycare. First time mom. Husband works a blue collar job. I make good money for our MCOL area but shit money compared to FAANG peeps. But I typically work strictly 40 hours/week and it's flexible. We cannot afford an in home nanny.


This part is about baby/daycare specifics so skip this paragraph to get to the work stuff. He's so little. He's still unable to fall asleep on his own and he does not sleep very long in his bassinet during the day so I've been doing a lot of contact napping. Also the daycare has had a change in management since we signed him up for it and they've been hard to reach/accumulating some bad reviews since then. Also also, I made the mistake of reading about how, while older kids do well in preschool to help prepare them for kindergarten in terms of social and academic achievements, there are only negative outcomes associated with a baby under a year old going into daycare. I'm just getting super nervous about all of this and I'm literally losing sleep over it (which is hard to come by at the moment to begin with haha).


I have had a couple coworkers (admittedly more in project management type roles) tell me just keep the baby at home for the first year! It'll be fine! I just don't understand how that's gonna work. I have days of back to back meetings, presenting or leading coding ensembles, trying to focus and get work done. He's still too young to get on a schedule, and he was slightly underbaked. We can start working towards a schedule soon but it's way too chaotic at the moment. I am not nursing or pumping so that doesn't factor into all of this.


An additional complicating factor... My team, who had been together for 5+ years, was disbanded three weeks before I had to have my baby. I have been shoved into a ""solution architect"" position now, and despite me begging for time with my new manager, no one took the time to explain wtf you actually do as a SA in our company and what my new role responsibilities were. My team never worked with one so I have no idea. I spent those 3 weeks (before I suddenly developed pre-eclampsia and had to deliver) being upset about the changes, mad about no one communicating with me, and just mad in general cause I was heavily pregnant in the dead of summer haha. So there's a high degree of uncertainty of what I'll be doing when I do get back. And I'm sad that there's a good possibility I won't be coding anymore, won't be leading and mentoring anymore, but the job market appears to be shit so all in all feeling stuck, frustrated, anxious, and hormonal.

I got almost 15 years experience in the business, I've proven myself plenty of times. I know the good life is earned and not owed. But I just want to be able to cruse with a little less stress and drama for the next 3-5. I'm not looking for a FAANG job, not even a F500 job. I can't relocate because of the kids and family, and I've given plenty of thoughts to changing domain, to no avail..

  
Not quite sure what I'm hoping this post will bring me. A shot in the dark for an attaboy, I guess?",44,2089,2134,0.072,0.8,0.128,0.9762,Positive,False,False,False

1njb0d3,Why do software engineers talk so much about their salaries and perks compared to other fields?,"I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.

Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.

There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:

* Corporate law - long hours at the top firms, but once you make partner or move in-house, the pay and perks can be incredible.
* Management consulting - high salaries, travel perks, and later the option to slide into cushy corporate strategy roles.
* Finance (investment banking, hedge funds, private equity) - brutal in the early years, but the compensation and eventual lifestyle roles can be extremely attractive.
* Pharma/biotech corporate roles - especially regulatory affairs, medical affairs, or corporate strategy, where salaries and work-life balance can be excellent.
* Government or quasi-gov jobs - not always “high salary” in the traditional sense, but great stability, pensions, benefits, and very relaxed day-to-day in some roles.

I think tech gets the spotlight partly because

1. It’s more relatable, everyone uses apps and websites, so people “get” what a software engineer does
2. The industry actively markets itself through social media and content like those “Day in the Life” vlogs

Meanwhile, most law firms or finance offices aren’t putting out lifestyle videos showing their perks

1nke8ct,No CS degree in ML: is the only way to be hired at OpenAI/Google is to publish novel (conference-grade) technology?,"Hello,

So, I don’t know where to start, but let’s lay the foundation:

* I’m 20,
* My parents pushed me into a business & management degree when I was 16
* I didn’t want business and management, so on my first summer I have learned Java and got a job in October that year.
* 4 months later (2022) I decided to quit the job to start a startup. I’ve never worked a job since. Didn’t work though.
* A year ago (2024), I’ve graduated and decided to start a startup in AI. It didn’t work either, because I’ve tried to do something very difficult, alone. Along the lines, I’ve realized that I should get a job first.

I’ve been told by many that the only way to get a job in a decent company is by have a record of published conference writings. So I did try it. 

In May 2024, I’ve started working on a pretty ambitious project in robotics. I thought I would be done in two weeks. I didn’t finish it in 4 months (note: I was unemployed throughout the whole time. I’ve stopped because I was looking for a job, and couldn’t find anything at all - no companies in my small country (Ireland) are hiring in robotics).

I’m now working in other projects. These are in LLMs, and technically simpler, but still, I thought I would do it in 40-60 hours, but even collecting a basic set of data is already taking me 70! I am also working in physical labor job at the moment. 

Which makes me reconsider the entire thing.

Is the premise of “you have to publish in top conferences to work” real? To be clear, I really want to a) get employed b) ideally, somehow, get a Masters in AI/ML - and part of the reason why I do these projects is to qualify myself for the latter. Which pushes me into PhD-level research which is normally not done alone; and I have little experience in e.g. LLMs because I was after robotics for so long, which likely - will lead to failure at one point or another.

Ugh. I don’t know what to do in this position.

I’m after these many difficult projects, which require time, which makes me prioritize the projects instead of further learning (*e.g.* how to use MLOps observability & pipeline tools instead of writing own code). But this is the only way to prove myself?

So, are we supposed to publish ICML-level code to work? 

What makes it worse is that - even though I have excellent math, stat and ML foundations now, I can't easily tell whether the project I'm working on will work or not (and I'm not getting a job if it fails). Because naturally, doing novel work is not exactly certain.

(note: I've put OpenAI/Google at the top because FAANG is forbidden in titles. But I mean, in general, any serious lab/ML engineering company)

> Are you using AI? How does it help you?

I've been giving them my honest answer.

* AI slows me down workflow.
* It does not and cannot refactor or rearchitect code in my own vision.
* I have to re-write almost every line of AI-generated code because it's just incomplete or incorrect. It takes me longer to write a prompt that generates ""correct code"" than it takes to just write the code.
* I thought it was a really neat tool when it wrote a Powershell script for me.
* But, on any bigger task, it just failed to live up to hype.
* I work more efficiently writing my own code, than trying to coax an AI into doing the work for me.

Employers hear my words, and they think I'm a dinosaur falling behind the tech curve.

Here’s the catch:

* They charge **CAD 7,500 total**.
* Payment structure: CAD 1,500 upfront as a security deposit, another CAD 1,000 at the background check stage, and the rest spread over 3 months of my salary once I’m placed.

* They’re headquartered in New York, but most of their staff is based in India.

Some background: my mom has been dealing with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My dad died almost exactly one year ago, the same week my live-in partner admitted to being unfaithful and left me. I am getting help but dealt with severe depression before this, and all this launched me into a new stratosphere of grief. This got even worse when we found out my mom’s cancer spread again last month. I’ve barely been able to feed myself, bathe, or do the bare minimum at my current job.

I’m a data engineer and I am currently employed at an ok company doing consulting. It’s not perfect, upper management is abusive with our time and there is client drama. I have no intention of staying long term but I’ve been there over a year and it’s remote so I can visit my mom and qualify for FMLA.

A few months back when things were ok with my mom, I applied for a job at databricks for a solution architect and unexpectedly got an interview several months later. It’s also remote, and I wouldn’t get FMLA if I needed it. 

I am unhappy at my current job and this pays more so I wanted to give it a shot. Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. It’s all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. I’m very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that I’ve squandered this opportunity.

I had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, I’m afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But I’m not. 

I’m afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, I’ll end up in a situation where I’ll get fired or they’ll find out I’m not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I can’t code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just can’t now.

I don’t know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter. I don’t even want to try to take the assessment because I’m so overwhelmed, I’m behind at my current job and don’t have the time or energy for the interview process, but I also feel stuck and sad at my current job, at least I’m comfortable though.

1ni5f9w,Founder Says It’s “Too Early” to Discuss Compensation in the Final Round,"Hey everyone,

I was interviewing for a Founding Engineer role at a startup that expected 6 days a week, 9 AM to 9 PM, in office. Towards the end of the final interview, I asked about compensation and the founder said:

*“I have not had a candidate ask about the compensation this early.”*  
*“It’s too early to discuss compensation.”*

After I pushed, he finally mentioned a range of 150k to 220k, but it was clear he didn’t want to talk numbers until the very end. The whole process felt like the company had unreasonable expectations, no respect for work-life balance, and zero transparency about pay.

I was interviewing for a Founding Engineer role at a startup that expected 6 days a week, 9 AM to 9 PM, in office. Towards the end of the final interview, I asked about compensation and the founder said:

*“I have not had a candidate ask about the compensation this early.”*  
*“It’s too early to discuss compensation.”*

After I pushed, he finally mentioned a range of 150k to 220k, but it was clear he didn’t want to talk numbers until the very end. The whole process felt like the company had unreasonable expectations, no respect for work-life balance, and zero transparency about pay.

1ni9htj,Finishing a CS degree and realizing you're really crap at software dev. What to do?,"The way I learnt to code was kind of backwards. I started off on forums like MPGH, first learning how to use a debugger, then learning x86 asm, and then C. For most of my coding ""life"", I just wrote everything in asm, and then later on C but still mostly asm because I found everything else kind of confusing. I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),

This kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the ""low-level"", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.

Now I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.

I struggle to use git lol

CI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusing

I struggle with database stuff

I struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own ""OOP"" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.

Get fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shit

All of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool ""high level"" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.

It's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.

None of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).

None of these things are ""software"" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).

To be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field. The thing I noticed when studying is the things I struggled with was entirely inverse from my peers.

1niu6we,SDET intern at bigger company vs SWE internship at lesser known company?,"Hi guys,

I am currently a 3rd year Canadian computer science student and I just got 2 offers. One is an SDET role at a small unicorn and the other is a SWE position at a smaller manufacturing company. I am debating on which one would be better for my career. I am most likely looking for SWE internships in the future, and I will have 3 coop terms left in my degree after this internship (so a few chances for me to pivot I guess). Both offers are for 8 months. This is my first internship as well for added context.

The working conditions (office, team experience/mentorship, etc) at the unicorn also seems far better than the manufacturing company but I’m a bit skeptical of the job title  and my responsibilities there especially with all the hate from this thread for testing jobs. Pay is about the same for both companies after considering reallocation.

I didn’t specify exact company names for privacy but I hope this helps. Both jobs are in Canada.

1nj1rsm,Should I get a degree in computer science?,"I am sure you all get this question a lot, but I have a relatively unique situation.

Long story short, I never went to college because I was depressed in high school and didn't think I'd get anywhere or that I was smart enough. I was also terrified about the prospect of failing out and simultaneously dealing with homelessness/unemployment and student debt. 

I went into the workforce, and got into IT which was my original plan. For the past 3 years I've been working as an overnight datacenter technician at a hyperscaler. I'm high tenure, and get exceed high bar ratings on performance reviews.

But I've been beginning to question whether I should get a degree. I am more disciplined now that I'm older and live on my own. 

My father recently called me and told me that I could likely get my grandmother to pay for my tuition, but she doesn't have much time left, so time is important. 


Is the computer science market as bad as people say it is? I have a handful of connections who are software devs at MAG7 companies, but I'm wondering if it'd be worth it or if I should keep my current career trajectory. I'd need to go to community college and transfer, and probably need to take some remedial math courses since it's been a while since I was in school.

So is it worth it? Or is the bird in the hand still worth the two in the bush?

I am sure you all get this question a lot, but I have a relatively unique situation.

Long story short, I never went to college because I was depressed in high school and didn't think I'd get anywhere or that I was smart enough. I was also terrified about the prospect of failing out and simultaneously dealing with homelessness/unemployment and student debt. 

I went into the workforce, and got into IT which was my original plan. For the past 3 years I've been working as an overnight datacenter technician at a hyperscaler. I'm high tenure, and get exceed high bar ratings on performance reviews.

But I've been beginning to question whether I should get a degree. I am more disciplined now that I'm older and live on my own. 

My father recently called me and told me that I could likely get my grandmother to pay for my tuition, but she doesn't have much time left, so time is important. 


Is the computer science market as bad as people say it is? I have a handful of connections who are software devs at MAG7 companies, but I'm wondering if it'd be worth it or if I should keep my current career trajectory. I'd need to go to community college and transfer, and probably need to take some remedial math courses since it's been a while since I was in school.

So is it worth it? Or is the bird in the hand still worth the two in the bush?

1nin381,Need advice on preparing for a job switch,"Thanks in advance. First of all, about myself:  I'm a SWE with 12YOE. I've been at my current job for about 6 yrs and have previously worked at one of those FAANG companies. My current level is equivalent of Amazon senior/sde3, meta E5.

The reasons I want to make the switch are:

1. It's mentally draining to work in a SaaS company that's run by a bunch of MBAs, including the big wigs in engineering . The huge bureaucracy machine turns engineers into clerks. I understand the intention of all the paperwork and guardrails is to safeguard any outage but the execution of it is by imposing a one-size-fit-all template of process that makes no sense for a lot of services and we end up spending a good chunk of the time just filing paperwork to get exemption or implementing some bullshit no-op guardrails that provides no real value to anyone but just checkmarks the item off the list.

2. I'm on an infrastructure team and it's ops heavy(which is fine but it's not as interesting). We run one of those Apache open source data systems. Operating hundreds of clusters means the majority of work is ensuring high availability, keeping the light on and configuration. We don't really code that much on the job. Everyone becomes yaml engineer. I was fortunate enough to design and code a project from scratch and bring it to production and evolve it for a couple years but eventually handed it over to others in India.

3. Working with junior engineers poses some challenges(maybe I'm inexperienced to coaching and my expectation is too high). The younger engineers on my team (4-6 YOE) are more or less like senior junior. They started off as a new grads and only worked at this company and their exposure to different tech stack is very limited and since there's not a lot of coding involved in the job. When they do code, the quality is really bad. None of them read the book like Refactoring, Clean Code, etc so IMO they couldn't even tell what's good code vs bad code simply because they didn't develop a taste. I've tried to coach but they don't seem very motivated and didn't bother to read even though other seniors also recommended those book lists to them. I don't have a CS degree and basically taught myself programming the final year in my graduate school but I already knew more stuff in the 2nd year of my professional career than these senior juniors. When I have to work with someone who cares more about the optics of others on the team(support from peers is the name of the game for promotion here) than honing their craft, it grinds my gears since they deliver subpar products, incur tech debt on purpose just to complete the task to appear productive and I often have to pick up the mess behind them with no credit.

OK, the above is my gripe. Sorry for digressing. I'm still going to try to bring my best to this job but also want to prepare myself for tech interviews when a good opportunity shows itself in this touch market. 

**TL;DR**

**My main questions are:**

1. What qualities do interviewers evaluate for roles with my YOE and level or higher? Asking this question to get a sense in which areas should I focus more during preparation.

2. Do interviewers still ask leetcode/hackerrank kind of algo questions when they evaluate senior engineers? I always think of these questions are basically IQ test to filter out obvious unfit candidates but they don't really map to whether someone is a good engineer or not. I know I'm a good engineer but my current coding proficiency definitely can't compare to 10 years ago due to lack of usage and being spoiled by IDE autocomplete. Will I be evaluated on coding questions like a new grad or someone who's straight from a coding bootcamp? When I interview a candidate, I'd rather hire someone who can explain their thoughts well but didn't complete the code than someone who produces a working solution but the code looks bad and the process leading to that solution is messy.

3. What's your recommendation on how to prepare for interviews? What material do you recommend to read? I know the book System Design Interview  by Alex Xu. Any strategy on how I can upskill my coding efficiency and become more eloquent on design questions? Should I practice on Hard problems for coding puzzles?

1niy1xi,Is CS an engineering degree?,"I'm in the US as an incoming freshmen to my university so I apologize if this is a stupid question that has already been asked: Why do so many people on here classify a computer science program as an engineering program?

By using the seach function on this subreddit, I see there are three explanations people usually give: (1) their CS program was in an engineering school, (2) their CS program was ABET accredited, (3) they get a job with the title ""engineer"" anyway. The problem is that I disagree with all of these. Let me explain.

(1) Some CS programs are in an Engineering School

When looking at CS programs of universities I wanted to apply to, this initially confused me. So before I accepted admittance into my current university, I spoke with various advisors from each university I was accepted into and they all told me the same thing - roughly that a “school” within a university is just a made up construct by the university and not to get too hung up on it. The discussions always boiled down to that a ""school"" within a university is created to group together related degree programs and it has no meaning outside that particular university, nor does it automatically classify the programs within it as “engineering” programs. One of them evem gave the straight forward example of:

>An electrical engineering program would still be an engineering program if it was held in a universities ""School of Arts and Sciences"" or if it was held in a universities ""Engineering School"". So by extention a Computer Science program is still a science program, no matter if it's in a universities ""School of Arts and Sciences"" or in a universities ""Engineering School"".

(2) Some CS programs are ABET accredited

When discussing with an an advisor at one of the schools, they told me about ABET. But they told me if a computer science degree is ABET accredited, it will be accredited as a CAC ABET (Computing Accreditation Commission) and not an EAC (Engineering Accreditation Commission) and thus technically not seen as an engineering degree by the US administration in charge of engineering licensure. 


(3) They get a job with the title of ""engineer"" anyway

This seems like it's a US thing (I think other countries make it illegal to be titled as an ""engineer"" if you don't have an engineering education. But isn't it just fake? I mean if ""doctor"" wasn't a protected title, a company could give you the title of ""Software Doctor"".

(2) Some CS programs are ABET accredited

When discussing with an an advisor at one of the schools, they told me about ABET. But they told me if a computer science degree is ABET accredited, it will be accredited as a CAC ABET (Computing Accreditation Commission) and not an EAC (Engineering Accreditation Commission) and thus technically not seen as an engineering degree by the US administration in charge of engineering licensure. 


(3) They get a job with the title of ""engineer"" anyway

This seems like it's a US thing (I think other countries make it illegal to be titled as an ""engineer"" if you don't have an engineering education. But isn't it just fake? I mean if ""doctor"" wasn't a protected title, a company could give you the title of ""Software Doctor"". And furthermore, you don't even need a degree to get hired at a US company and yet you become an ""engineer""",28,2550,2579,0.044,0.92,0.035,-0.7056,Negative,False,False,False

I graduated in recent years and secured a software engineer job a couple months after graduation doing standard dev work in the traditional way (no AI). Unfortunately, I was laid off about a year later.

I've since landed a new role, the title is Software Engineer, but it is very AI centric, and any dev work is heavily done using AI tools where software engineers more or less prompt and review the generated code. Writing actual code is minimal, just small tweaks to results. The brainwork is mostly being offloaded to AI, we're instructed to write agents to attempt to automate almost anything and everything.

I’m concerned about not being able to grow my dev skills. I genuinely miss writing and reading code and delving into codebases to solve problems. I miss debugging/troubleshooting, and learning intricacies, nuances, and quirks of the language and technologies that I am working with.

In the off chance that these AI tools for dev work end up being scrapped several years down the line, I’m concerned that my skills will not have grown here. I’ve already heard first hand stories of experienced devs using these kinds of tools feeling as if their skills are dulling.

Still being very early in my career, I’m wondering if I should stay in my current role (because this may be the future), or if I should try to find a job with a company that still does traditional software engineering with complemental AI use (e.g. Copilot in VS) to help me hone my raw SDE skills.

I personally feel that these AI tools are best used by experienced engineers who have learned over time what to ask for, what looks good etc. I feel as though it is probably easier for an experienced dev to learn and make use of AI tools/coding assistants than someone who’s inexperienced and won't know enough to even know what to look for.

So regardless of where things are headed, I think that real life hands-on coding experience is going to be king, but this is just one opinion. I'd like to hear some different points of view so I can make an informed choice.

Are there any arguments for me staying in an AI centric role (which may be the future)? Or should I try and move back to a traditional dev role (which may serve me best regardless)?

Perhaps ""AI Vibe Coding"" was the wrong term, even though my job title is still Software Engineer, my role is more like ""Prompt Engineer"".

1ni0oyu,"Cant seem to ""stick"" with a CS career choice?","TL;DR: Stuck with finding something im going to truly enjoy for work down the road, because Im afraid that I might just get sick of it and throw it away, jumping into something new and ""shiny"". And because of this, I don't know how I can find something that I really enjoy doing, and thus a bit misdirected as to where i should put my energy into

Yes, im 18 and shouldn't ""really"" be contemplating career choices right now, but Im one of those kids who was programming literally from the womb. Ive competed and won Informatics events, done hackathons, and even ML research. It was fun, SUPER fun and enjoyed every bit of it. Of course, naturally I took interest in computer science, and some advanced units too . But I quickly came to realise that the reason programming was fun was NOT because of programming itself, but rather the freedom in which I could explore and have fun with it. Now that i literally have to code for a degree, its taken the life out of it for me. I used to enjoy writing code, seeing what this line does vs that line. But now that i actually have to do it for assessment,s tasks, and soon in the workforce, its like im being ""forced"" rather than doing it for fun. Yes, ive tried branching out, doing different projects instead of focusing on uni, and while those are fun, I quickly lose motivation for them in about 2 weeks.

I do have very slight ADHD and shiny object syndrome, where if I see something new ill jump into it instantly, delve into it for about 2 weeks, and then lose interest. Maybe its because of all the reel scrolling reducing my attention span, but i thing the deeper reason is my lack of interest. As a matter of fact, Ive found some new hobbies which I LOVE , like cooking, rock climbing, the gym, and photography. But id never wanna be a fitness influence, a chef or a photographer, just because im afraid that once im forced to do it it becomes me ""Living to Work"" rather than ""Working to live"". I wanna do something Im happy with, and honestly, typing mind numbing code while copy pasting from an AI and having meetings in a 9 - 5 doesn't appeal to me.

The money or the job opportunities was never a driver for me, rather I want to do something that makes me happy. I want to use my teens and early 20's to work as hard as I can and become the best in my field, so It will pay off later. And yes, don't get me wrong, i love tech, and i don't regret choosing this degree. i love the part where i get to think to solve hard algorithms, i get to prove complex math formulas, or mimic a hacker penetrating my home system. I love things that make me think, and challenge me, and programming is not that anymore. Maybe its because its first year and I have already done this stuff before, but I have a feeling that the more I go through with the programming element, the more im gonna lose the taste for it.

My degree has a 4th year inbuilt honours, where we get to research any topic we want (in the computer science field). Im hoping that by then, i will have found something im content with and love, like algorithmics, or network stuff, or mathematical algorithm proofs. (Which i can still do).

However, the big problem is that I have this knack for programming. And i feel like switching to something else (like ML research, cyber security) is me wasting the talent i have to become a quant, or a software developer (basically a programming workhorse, but to be fair AI will replace a bit of this).

So while I know that university is all about experiencing different topics, subjects and finding your own path, I came into the degree thinking that ""Im gonna become the most specialized, and the top of my field"". But now Ive lost the drive, but too scared to shift my focus from it.

1ngxdn9,How to get a raise when CEO sets salary unilaterally?,"Hi all,

I’m a Senior Front-End Engineer with +10 years experience, coming to 3 years at an aggressively expanding US-based remote company that benchmarks salaries to Western Europe. My current base is €73.000 feels like its below market for my experience. 

The challenge: the CEO just sets the salary — no negotiation. I’ve contributed significantly last year:

Soloed a browser extension project outside of my usual responsibilities (design+implementation), influenced all aspects of the current UI — both aesthetics and UX. Created Figma prototypes, assets, and animations to elevate design quality when I felt the designer fell short, led decisions on tech stack, and implemented numerous performance improvements.

Questions:
 - Am I wrong thinking in this market my compensation is not enough?
 - How would you approach getting a fair raise in this setup?
 - Maybe I would need to gather info how much direct impact I did on new customers?

Some extra info:
- got 10% raise after the first 6 months than 20% after 2 years in the same manner.

The current CTO is leaving and they are looking for their replacement - the title being changed to Principal since really, the CTO did nothing a CTO usually does. He has been focused on building the product and that is it. Founding engineer would be a more appropriate title.

1nhzfpq,Does a CS degree matter? Or Can someone with a neiche degree get a CS job?,"Before you guys start commenting please read fully.

I'm currently at one of Canada's top tech schools (University of Waterloo) studying Geomatics (i know what you are thinking but please hear me out before you say anything)

Here's my situation: I've always been interested Engineering, but chemistry ruined it for me, in programming and tech, but ended up in Geomatics due to many different circumstances (family, and some other stuff). Now I'm wondering, if I develop solid CS skills, build good projects, and really know my stuff, does my degree title actually matter?

Now, I'm not against the idea of Geomatics, it seems like a genuinely good, amazing and interesting field, but CS is ofc.. well the nearest i can be to an Engineering job...

I'm not gunning for FAANG or anything crazy like that. Sure, landing at Google would be a dream, but I'm not delusional. I just want a decent programming job where I can actually use my skills and enjoy what I do.

My questions:

* Do employers actually care about your degree being specifically ""Computer Science"" or do they care more about what you can build?
* Has anyone here gotten CS/software jobs with non-CS degrees? What was your experience?
* Would being from a school known for tech (Waterloo) help offset the ""weird degree"" thing?

I'm willing to put in the work to learn programming, build projects, contribute to open source, whatever it takes. I just want to know if I'm fighting an uphill battle because my degree says ""Geomatics"" instead of ""Computer Science.""

Frustrated with my team and going to get fired if I keep alienating myself by trying to do the right thing. Background: Only self-taught dev on my team, low/mid level, remote, love my company and very loyal for them taking a chance on me when I was an intern. Over the past year management changes have destroyed my team’s effectiveness.

QA: Obvious bugs are getting pushed daily, we lack testing, and there’s no chain of approval. People just click approve button after skimming the code. We have juniors approving and pushing each other’s code with no oversight. Sometimes the code doesn’t even work, or it doesn’t do what they think it’s doing due to inexperience in the codebase. I feel obligated to point out bugs etc when I see them, but I hate having to be the bad guy on a daily basis. Seniors don’t seem to care even when I bring it up to them.

Planning: Designers make tickets for feature work and throw them in “to-do”. Tickets are done out of order, so code written today will need to be rewritten next week when the other ticket is done. I feel obligated to try and point out that doing X before Y will mean we need to redo X, but they don’t see this as wasting time, they see me as blocking progress or Idk what I’m talking about because “it always works out anyway” (I always end up handling the duplicated work). Sometimes tickets literally cannot be done without core functionality from other tickets, so juniors will just do a crazy workaround or make the feature do something completely broken instead. We waste weeks arguing before management will finally let me fix things, then they complain I’m always prolonging simple tickets.

Architecture: There’s no technical design process at all. Management says they trust engineers to make those decisions on the fly, including juniors. The designers sometimes make a figma reference sheet that doesn’t even let you do the requested features, and juniors will code half of it before realizing they’re blocked then we go back to the drawing board, instead of listening to me pointing out “hey, this doesn’t look like it’s going to do what it seems like you’re asking for” during sprint planning. They claim I’m worrying too much about edge cases.

For example, a junior will pick up a ticket that should involve creating a system to support doing X task securely, using backend transactions etc. Instead of having a proper design doc to follow, they ad-lib it together using flaky frontend logic because they don’t know any better. They’ll have the frontend spoofing admin api calls to make those transactions work, creating a system that now requires the api to accept admin calls from non-admin JWT tokens. This means my next ticket has to follow their unsafe patterns, so I’m stuck refactoring their feature to something safe before I can even start my tickets. Me pointing this out as a problem leads to me getting labeled as nit-picky, too opinionated, and “thinking my way is the only way”.

I’ve been trying to affect change, but it’s above my pay grade and thus rejected because I have no authority whatsoever. Management pushes back publicly against my concerns, and when I’m proven right and end up fixing things, it’s generally in private so the general sentiment for me is low. I’m also advocating for better practices for technical planning, design, QA, etc but it’s led to me getting alienated from the rest of the team who thinks we’re doing just fine. Any conversation I start now leads to arguments because I immediately get mischaracterized as causing problems when I open my mouth. I’ll raise a concern, and the response is usually to the effect of “no it’s not” or “prove it”… so I will screenshare in the codebase why something is an issue, then get told “stop being too technical”.

1nh82ez,Need feedback on my portfolio projects (Ruby on Rails + React Native) and how to position myself on the market,"**TL;DR:** I’ve worked \~9 years in the same IT company (mostly backend, some frontend + DevOps). My salary is low (\~2/3 of country average). I built two showcase apps (Rails backend + React Native frontend) to better understand my market value. Looking for feedback on my execution, portfolio strength, what to improve, and whether I should present myself as junior/mid/senior. Also wondering if \~$20/h freelance (20h/week) is realistic.

Hey everyone,

I've been working in an IT company for about 9 years, always in the same company. My work is mostly backend, but sometimes I do a bit of frontend and DevOps as well. The issue is that my current salary is quite low, about 2/3 of the average salary in my country. The company also has some financial problems, but on the bright side, I get a lot of freedom and flexibility. Before I risk switching jobs or trying to build a second income stream, I want to better understand my real market value.

The challenge for me is that my company relies heavily on internal processes, workflows, and custom setups, so it’s hard to compare my experience with ""standard"" projects. That’s why I decided to build my own apps as a showcase of what I can actually do.

# What I built

I made two projects:

* A Ruby on Rails app with a CMS, user dashboard, public-facing part, and an API.
* A React Native (Expo) app that consumes the RoR API.

# The idea

Users can sign up or log in via either the web app or the mobile app. Once logged in, they can add products (with price and brand) and save them into lists. Each list has fields such as date, shop name, and value. Users can edit and delete both lists and products.

I intentionally kept the functionality simple so people can test it without friction. My goal wasn't to build a ""real"" product, but to create a minimal app that demonstrates everyday developer practices.

# What I worked with

**Ruby on Rails** (API + web app + CMS + user dashboard), using Devise for authentication.

* Two Devise models: Admins (login to CMS, only created by other admins) and Users (sign in to the dashboard to manage lists).
* No email confirmation because I didn't want to set up MailGun/SendGrid, but I understand the process (domains, spam issues, etc.).
* I use Tailwind CSS for frontend styling in my RoR app.
* Stimulus JS for interactivity (sorting, filtering, etc.).

**Mobile: React Native (Expo).**

Users can add products without signing in, but creating a lists requires a login.

* Authentication: the mobile app sends email/password to the Rails API, which returns a JWT token. The token unlocks all features (list + product management, user settings).
* Settings include: language (HR/EN/DE), currency (€/$), theme (light/dark).
* Legal pages are public and available in all three languages without changing settings.

**DevOps**

I Deployed the RoR app on a Hetzner server and installed Ubuntu 24, Nginx, Puma, cloned the RoR repo, precompiled assets, configured secrets, etc.

**Content**

I wrote demo texts in three languages I'm familiar with: Croatian, German, and English.

* I’m considering taking on freelance jobs in the \~$20/h range (about 20h/week alongside my current job). Is this realistic, or should I ask for more/less per hour and more/less hours per week?

1nhq05x,How will CS look in 2029?,"Hey all! So currently I am about to start up uni, doing a BCS, doing a major in computer science and a minor in either cybersecurity, or data science, also have the choice of swe (can double major but not sure if it's ideal). I also have a wide variety of double majors to pick from basically anything you can think of.

I will be graduating in 2029 from the University of Sydney. I have heard a lot of fear mongering about the impact of AI and how computer science is practically worthless, I don't buy into much of it, but I have to admit it is getting me very scared.

My family isn't particularly wealthy so I don't have much to fall back on either (no house or anything).  The reason I mention this is that I will likely have to support my parents as they age and would need a stable career for this.

Why computer science?

The reason im picking computer science over something like engineering is that I am disinterested with the work that engineers do, and I feel like computer science would allow me to have a more mobile job (as I want to work throughout the world and love learning new languages). Honestly my passion does not inherently lie with computer science, but there is no field that really interests me, so I just thought that this would be align with my plan for my future the most.

 Also another factor that drove me to this decision was that my dad is a computer science grad, and now is working as a solution architect from home, and I admire the career versatility that can come with jobs in tech, and the work life balance seems amazing.

If I didn't go with computer science I would likely look towards something like business administration or something in this field, purely because I really really dislike physics.

Basically the crux of my question is that, I know the current market is extremely competetitive for new grads, what do you guys think it will look like in 2029, will it be a stable career choice? Is it worth it to pursue this degree, even with the prevalence of AI? I understand that AI will create new jobs but won't it strip more than it will create?  I am not sure exactly what field of tech I wanna go into, was thinking cybersecurity (cloud security), or something along those lines but am not hard set on anything.

I also have a wide variety of double majors to pick from basically anything you can think of.

I will be graduating in 2029 from the University of Sydney. I have heard a lot of fear mongering about the impact of AI and how computer science is practically worthless, I don't buy into much of it, but I have to admit it is getting me very scared.

My family isn't particularly wealthy so I don't have much to fall back on either (no house or anything).  The reason I mention this is that I will likely have to support my parents as they age and would need a stable career for this.

- Database administration

- Learning new skills (data science, AI/ML, advanced LLM work)

Strengths: breaking down processes, managing international teams, delivering client projects. I've been all about ""delivery"" the last 15 years.

- Whether to pivot, stay broad, or narrow focus?

1nfcosg,Cultural differences in job search,"Hey all, 

I've been grinding through tech interviews and I've noticed some stark cultural differences. Disclaimer: this isn't about bias—it's just my personal observations and what I've heard from others in the industry. 

Not saying one way is better or worse, but it's definitely shaped how I prep.

From my experience, interviewers who grew up in the US (or 'completely Westernized') tend to keep things chill and conversational. They'll ask about your background, chat about past projects, and throw in questions that simulate problem-solving discussions. Often helpful with hints if you get stuck, and the vibe/culture fit is crucial. 

On the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more ""pass/fail"" mentality—either your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. 

I think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly. That mindset carries over here, e.g.treating work like a promotion game rather than delivering value.

Basically two styles: ""textbooker""  who want puzzle masters, vs. ""collaborative"" who prioritize discussion and personality.

And don't get me started on communication styles. Overall, it's made me adapt either memorizing hard LeetCode for certain rounds but appreciate the more human approach from others.

On the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more ""pass/fail"" mentality—either your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. 

I think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly. That mindset carries over here, e.g.treating work like a promotion game rather than delivering value.

Basically two styles: ""textbooker""  who want puzzle masters, vs. ""collaborative"" who prioritize discussion and personality.

And don't get me started on communication styles. Overall, it's made me adapt either memorizing hard LeetCode for certain rounds but appreciate the more human approach from others.

I'm currently a Senior SWE at a F50 non-tech company, but I only graduated 2 years ago. I've been employed with this company for about 4 years due to a university partnership (part time), and I was promoted to Senior after only a year of full time employment, about 6 months ago.

1nfrrhv,New Grad Dilemma - Taking advice,"**TL;DR:** Two return options from my internship at a Fortune 500. Head says **A (FTE)**, heart says **B (contract)**. What would you pick and why?

**Option A** — **Full-Time Employee (Salesforce Developer)**

* **Start:** Summer 2026
* **Comp:** \~$42/hour, **10% annual bonus target**, **401(k) 5% match + 5% automatic company contribution**, health coverage, PTO, etc.
* **Work:** Salesforce platform (Apex/LWC/Flows, integrations), enterprise processes, CI/CD, Agile.
* **Important constraints:** Internal transfer to the other team is **very unlikely**

**Pros:** Stability, total comp/benefits strong, clear runway, brand on résumé.  
**Cons:** I worry about being “pigeonholed” as a Salesforce dev for 12–18 months (I know maybe skills are transferable, but perception matters. I never really wanted to do Salesforce development in the first place.

**Option B — Contract Application Developer (React/Python/AWS on platform/enablement team)**

* Context: This is team that I interned on this past summer, a more “Fundamental SWE” team (my stack this summer was React/Python/AWS) starting part time this fall, transitioning to full time when I graduate Spring 2026.
* **Start:** Fall 2025 (earlier head start).
* **Comp:** $45–$50/hour, but no benefits, PTO, 401k, etc.
* **Conversion:** Manager is enthusiastic but **cannot promise** FTE or timeline in writing. Anecdotally, most of the previous contractors have converted to Full-Time after \~1 year, but it varies with headcount/budget.
* **Benefits:** I’m **on parents’ health insurance** until 26, so healthcare risk is lower.
* **Scope:** Modern stack (React, Python, AWS/Terraform, CI/CD).

**Pros:** Earlier start to my career, team that already knows me, tech stack I’m excited about, strong support, potentially faster learning.  
**Cons:** **No guaranteed conversion**, no benefits/PTO/bonus/401k match, risk if contract ends with no headcount. The rate may not fully offset the lost benefits.

**Bottom line:** If both roles were full-time I would take Option B, but the contract risk is real. My head says Option A, but my heart says Option B. What would you pick and why?

1nfhi3e,Received an entry level Platform Engineer offer and unsure about the position's potential,"Context:

I'm a Junior software engineer with about 2 years of experience and with no ops experience in my current position (mostly just React and Spring Boot developer work). I have started to dislike development work and wanted to pivot away from it. I'm not really sure at the moment what I want to do, but had an interest in trying for an infra / ops role.

I somehow managed to stumble upon and receive an offer for a ""Cloud Engineer"" position. Upon learning more about the position the role and research, the role seems to be like a Platform Engineer. Essentially I would be working on the company's Internal Developer Portal (IDP) powered by Backstage helping to research new developer tooling, supporting new pipelines, and helping to modernize and onboard applications teams to the platform. I believe another term for this would be building out a ""low code"" internal cloud platform

I have no connections that have experience working with IDPs so wanted to take a shot in the dark and seek out any engineers in this area of work or have worked adjacently with it and ask the following questions:

1. Am I pigeonholing myself to a certain niche in this kind of role? How applicable does work in this kind of position apply to other DevOps roles?
2. In your experience how difficult has it been getting application teams to transition to this kind of platform?
3. Is this an upcoming way of approaching and accelerating enterprise app deployment or has this been a relatively niche approach to maintaining infrastructure and operations that only certain companies pilot?

Any help on this would be appreciated as I have literally never seen this sort of position even within my current company.",5,0.86,3,2025-09-13 01:53:40,radioactiveflamingos,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nfhi3e/received_an_entry_level_platform_engineer_offer/,True,0,False,False,1,Saturday,2025-09-13,2025-09,0.5,2.58,"Received an entry level Platform Engineer offer and unsure about the position's potential Context:

1nf5eao,Leaving a cushy job for a startup?,"I currently make 105k in a stable boring job. Some weeks I work pretty hard, but there's a lot of slow periods where the amount of real work is very little. I get to WFH a little. Good benefits, stability, blah blah blah. Cheap city. Probably on track for a 10-20% promo in 6-18 months. I'm bored but comfortable. My rate of learning is pretty low and one of my biggest fears is stagnation. I'm the expert which is scary considering I'm not long out of  an M.S, I don't have anyone to learn from.

I'm looking at a 30% raise in base pay to join a startup, plus options to purchase 0.2% equity with 4 year vest. Current valuation is 60M after series A with 5M ARR and less than 20 employees. The downsides obviously include instability and the risk the equity is worth toilet paper. Unique to this role includes high amounts of travel. It's also riding the AI bubble so if that pops it would impact this company's perceived value and ability to get customers.

I might work like hell, get laid off in 6 months, have a resume that looks like shit? Or maybe the company will blow up and ill pick up a nest egg? I had one role for 16 months, and my current one would be 15 months, so I'm really worried about my resume optics if I take this job and they go under or I learn that I absolutely hate it.

1neh21v,This job market is destroying my sense of self worth.,"I managed in 2022 to get a tech job with little experience (non-cs degree). I worked there for 3 years but have now been unemployed for 9 months. Admittedly, I didn't spend that whole time looking, but much of it I have been applying, interviewing, talking to recruiters, reaching out to friends, networking on linkedin, emailing people that are recommended to me, adding projects to my portfolio. I have been doing this constantly on a weekly basis for months. Nothing. I haven't even sniffed an offer. 95% of the time I just get rejection emails. Many of these positions I am 100% qualified for, literally every single thing on the bullet points is something I have experience in and is on my resume. I know I am qualified. I know that I did good work at my last job. I know I am smart... right?

Lately I have been feeling like a complete and utter failure. Applying to jobs feels pointless since I never hear anything back. Even applying to similar positions to the one I left at the end of 2024 I get rejected for. Do I just forget my degree and go work as a waiter?

So what do y'all think? Do hiring managers not take you seriously if you have a social science BS & computer science MS because of cases like my friend? Would I get more out of a Master or Bachelors program?",28,1038,1067,0.031,0.88,0.089,0.9103,Positive,False,False,False
1nfdiaj,How to apply System design in real life,"I have been prepping up for system design using some online sources. Additionally I have also been attending some free live sessions where some senior engineers are doing practice sessions. 

Recently they were solving some problem related to consistency. They started with 2PC protocol but decided that it will be too stringent for all the use cases and  deteriorate the performance for all other cases as well. Then they decided to apply it only for that particular use case and further reduced it to very specific scenarios where it would be acceptable to have performance bottlenecks. 

After the session, it made complete sense of how they went about solving it. But if I had to do this on my own, it would have been impossible even if I were to use chatGPT

I was pretty shocked by the number. To give you the full picture, when they asked for my salary expectations, I said around $130k base pay. Their response was that I was asking for a **FAANG senior level base pay**. A friend of mine told me something similar, too.

But everything I've seen online (Levels.fyi, Blind, etc.) shows new grad tech roles in the $110k-$150k range. Now I'm completely confused. Was I living in an illusion thinking that number was achievable? Or is $62k a major lowball, even for a new startup in Chicago?

1nf7t8d,Should I leave for a high pay bump?,"Hi,

  
I am currently working for a company that has a really good work-life balance and my coworkers are treating me very well (sometimes I feel like we are friends, not even work colleague). However, the pay is under average and I am not learning anything new (feeling stagnant). I recently got an offer for a big tech company with a massive pay raise 80% of my current salary. However, the company is known to have a very competitive environment and don't have a good work-life balance. My family worried that I may not be able to handle the work-load there or getting laid off eventually. Do you think I should take the offer?



Thank you guys.  


Edit: btw, i thought this is important to mention, but I am young and don’t have wife/kids. 

Final edit: I have accepted the offer. Thanks everyone for your advice

1ndiw92,Working at a startup taught me more in 3 years than 10+ years at larger companies. I wish I did it sooner.,"It has been a career bucket list item to work at a startup that is just getting off the ground.  I joined as a staff engineer on a central platform team with one other engineer.  Eventually the team grew to 4 engineers.  As startups tend to do the financials struggled and the team was let go.  However with everything I learned I could confidently speak about almost all parts of platform engineering with hands-on confidence I did 1 interview which resulted in 1 offer.  [Note: It was a company I had previously worked for and knew lots of people.  This isn't a brag about getting a job in a struggling market so this context is important.]  Here is some of my experiences.

Working at large companies things tend to be somewhat figured out.  A typical question I would get when interviewing new engineers for roles on the team was about what the most difficult part of the job is.  My honest answer was always there was me and another engineer.  If we didn't know the answer that means you have to figure it out because no one else at the company knows.  These are some of the parts of the job I always knew about but lacked working hands-on:


**DNS** - At every company I worked for DNS was managed by another team, typically SREs.  I knew about various record types and all that and I knew how to dig a DNS record but here we had to setup the R53 ourselves, purchase the domains ourselves, setup the subdomains ourselves and setup all the record ourselves.  We had to figure out how to manage this in a sustainable way so DNS isn't spread across a bunch of AWS accounts and do that in a secure fashion.


**CICD** - Of course every engineer oftentimes interfaces with CICD.  My experience was typically extending some scripts someone else wrote to do most of the hard stuff.  The cluster was owned and operated by someone else.  But we had to figure out what CICD to use, how to integrate it into our pipelines, how to build our services, how to house containers, how to deploy the services.  There was no service builder helper to extend it had to start from scratch.


**App Startup** - The companies I worked for already had app startup figured out.  There was some framework you'd implement which would give you logging, metrics and some form of observability for free out of the box.  But we had to figure out how to get these apps running and build out this framework ourselves.  This even included selecting which language to use for our platform, how to structure the project and coding standards.


**Infrastructure** - Every place loves to interview you on scalability but I've personally always found it somewhat abstracted away from me as the developer.  My job was to crunch the code to make my container and it was someone else's job to scale it up or at least provide a convenient way to do so - usually some core tech team.  At the very least usually stuff before it hits your code is owned and operated by someone else.  Now again we leveraged AWS so lots of it is batteries included.  The API Gateways scale, if we're using serverless it scales, if we're using a managed database it scales.  But not everything was managed.  So we typically had to write out the entire infrastructure diagrams ourselves and find scale points.  This allowed me to walk into system design interviews not just spewing out memorization about various scaling techniques I actually had to live and breathe it for a long time.  Questions about trade offs and decisions were now extremely easy to talk about because these were things I actually had to solve personally.


**IAC** - I lacked a lot of Terraform know-how going into the job.  So even simple questions which I now know as Terraform 101 such as ""How do I save this state file from my ephemeral CICD node?"" were complete unknowns.  We had to figure out basically everything Terraform from scratch.  Companies I've worked for in the past usually didn't expose Terraform to me directly.  They were hybrid bare metal and public cloud options.  So we had some form of IAC but it was always proprietary to the company, usually owned and managed by someone else and typically pared down.  So this gave me direct exposure to how to describe my infrastructure as code including things like I said about how to save state files, how to tag my resources, how to manage int/dev/stage/prod environments and all of that.  My previous experience was just writing some YAML and it was someone else's job to interpret all of that.


**Observability** - Like I said previously usually this is something included in the app framework of the company.  But this gave me experience setting up Grafana (our tool of choice), pumping or replicating logs to it, setting up collectors for metrics, setting up alerting and all the dashboarding.  The alerting and dashboarding I'm sure most people have had experience with but usually for logging and metrics I'd just have to inject something into my application and it ""just worked"" without having to think about it too terribly much.


This is a long winded post and not a question at all but more a bit of advice.  If you are given the opportunity to work at a very early stage start up I highly recommend it.  My end result was the same as most early start ups - I got let go.  However I feel it made me a much more employable engineer that now can talk about times I actually built a lot of components that go into a backend platform.  I don't need to talk about these things in the abstract, which of course is still important to understand, but I can speak to them in the concrete now.  It was a fantastic growing and learning experience for me, personally.",332,0.93,53,2025-09-10 19:25:03,d_wilson123,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ndiw92/working_at_a_startup_taught_me_more_in_3_years/,True,0,False,False,19,Wednesday,2025-09-10,2025-09,0.15915915915915915,49.29,"Working at a startup taught me more in 3 years than 10+ years at larger companies.

I knew about various record types and all that and I knew how to dig a DNS record but here we had to setup the R53 ourselves, purchase the domains ourselves, setup the subdomains ourselves and setup all the record ourselves.  We had to figure out how to manage this in a sustainable way so DNS isn't spread across a bunch of AWS accounts and do that in a secure fashion.


**CICD** - Of course every engineer oftentimes interfaces with CICD.  My experience was typically extending some scripts someone else wrote to do most of the hard stuff.  The cluster was owned and operated by someone else.  But we had to figure out what CICD to use, how to integrate it into our pipelines, how to build our services, how to house containers, how to deploy the services.  There was no service builder helper to extend it had to start from scratch.


**App Startup** - The companies I worked for already had app startup figured out.  There was some framework you'd implement which would give you logging, metrics and some form of observability for free out of the box.  But we had to figure out how to get these apps running and build out this framework ourselves.  This even included selecting which language to use for our platform, how to structure the project and coding standards.


**Infrastructure** - Every place loves to interview you on scalability but I've personally always found it somewhat abstracted away from me as the developer.  My job was to crunch the code to make my container and it was someone else's job to scale it up or at least provide a convenient way to do so - usually some core tech team.  At the very least usually stuff before it hits your code is owned and operated by someone else.  Now again we leveraged AWS so lots of it is batteries included.  The API Gateways scale, if we're using serverless it scales, if we're using a managed database it scales.  But not everything was managed.  So we typically had to write out the entire infrastructure diagrams ourselves and find scale points.  This allowed me to walk into system design interviews not just spewing out memorization about various scaling techniques I actually had to live and breathe it for a long time.  Questions about trade offs and decisions were now extremely easy to talk about because these were things I actually had to solve personally.


**IAC** - I lacked a lot of Terraform know-how going into the job.  So even simple questions which I now know as Terraform 101 such as ""How do I save this state file from my ephemeral CICD node?"" were complete unknowns.  We had to figure out basically everything Terraform from scratch.  Companies I've worked for in the past usually didn't expose Terraform to me directly.  They were hybrid bare metal and public cloud options.  So we had some form of IAC but it was always proprietary to the company, usually owned and managed by someone else and typically pared down.  So this gave me direct exposure to how to describe my infrastructure as code including things like I said about how to save state files, how to tag my resources, how to manage int/dev/stage/prod environments and all of that.  My previous experience was just writing some YAML and it was someone else's job to interpret all of that.


**Observability** - Like I said previously usually this is something included in the app framework of the company.  But this gave me experience setting up Grafana (our tool of choice), pumping or replicating logs to it, setting up collectors for metrics, setting up alerting and all the dashboarding.  The alerting and dashboarding I'm sure most people have had experience with but usually for logging and metrics I'd just have to inject something into my application and it ""just worked"" without having to think about it too terribly much.


This is a long winded post and not a question at all but more a bit of advice.  If you are given the opportunity to work at a very early stage start up I highly recommend it.  My end result was the same as most early start ups - I got let go.  However I feel it made me a much more employable engineer that now can talk about times I actually built a lot of components that go into a backend platform.  I don't need to talk about these things in the abstract, which of course is still important to understand, but I can speak to them in the concrete now.  It was a fantastic growing and learning experience for me, personally.",106,5646,5753,0.017,0.916,0.068,0.9945,Positive,True,False,True

1nekw85,Moving back to the Bay for career potential? From Dallas,"**Need some career advice (and maybe personal life advice too).**

I moved to DFW a few years ago, my family relocated here, my wife got a job offer right out of college, and I had just finished my military service. I went to college here, bought a house, and landed my first SWE job at a Fortune 500 company (3+ years of experience now).

Financially, things have gone well. My wife and I have been able to build a lot of wealth here, and life has been good—though never fully satisfying. Every summer we end up flying back to California to see her family and our friends.

**Numbers:**

* My comp this year: $115k salary + $15k bonus
* Wife’s comp: $117k salary, fully remote
* Extra income: \~$27k/year VA disability

The issue: I’m not really satisfied with my job anymore. At first, we had a great project, but over time poor leadership, endless contractors, and unclear vision drove morale down. A lot of people have quit, and the work just isn’t fulfilling anymore.

I’ve looked for other opportunities in DFW, but most of the stronger roles seem to be back in the Bay Area. My company has a Palo Alto office, and a role opened up there. I interviewed, got the offer, and negotiated $140k base salary with $5k relocation. It’s a lateral transfer, but my wife’s salary likely won’t adjust upward since she’s remote and her company considers it a voluntary transfer.

We’ve always talked about moving back to the Bay long term, and now feels like the time. We want to start a family soon, and we’d have family support both here and there. We have no debt (cars paid off, no student loans), just a mortgage. The plan would be to rent out our house here through a property management company—not for profit, just to hold onto it. In the Bay, we’d rent something modest and avoid buying.

We know the cost of living will be higher, but the goal has always been to return to California. This transfer seems like the best option since I haven’t had luck with external offers. I’m also hoping to get more exposure to new tech by being there.

1necyqv,Confused between SDET and Dev role,"

Not sure if this is the right subreddit but here goes

I’ve Been working at a product based company as an SDET for the last 3 years. Month or so back we were told QA/SDET teams were being moved into a different role - Engineering services that’s more like a business/data analyst role (with fancier title) OR development (you get 12 weeks to complete transition)

 The testing will be taken over by devs and the automation too (only regression automation team or 5-6 members will continue their existing role) 

I applied at other places and got a couple of offers from 2 product based companies for the SDET role. 

Put in my notice and now the current org wants me to stay and are trying to match the offers I have and also giving me leeway in the engineering services role where I’ll get more time to learn on the side and prepare for the dev role and eventually transition into development

I’m not sure if I continue on the SDET path at a new org or should I stay here and transition into development (not sure if I’ll be able to that’s my main concern, I have a sufficient enough grasp of Java and selenium and api automation as well but development looks way more difficult for me at the moment)

Not sure if this is the right subreddit but here goes

I’ve Been working at a product based company as an SDET for the last 3 years. Month or so back we were told QA/SDET teams were being moved into a different role - Engineering services that’s more like a business/data analyst role (with fancier title) OR development (you get 12 weeks to complete transition)

 The testing will be taken over by devs and the automation too (only regression automation team or 5-6 members will continue their existing role) 

I applied at other places and got a couple of offers from 2 product based companies for the SDET role. 

Put in my notice and now the current org wants me to stay and are trying to match the offers I have and also giving me leeway in the engineering services role where I’ll get more time to learn on the side and prepare for the dev role and eventually transition into development

I’m not sure if I continue on the SDET path at a new org or should I stay here and transition into development (not sure if I’ll be able to that’s my main concern, I have a sufficient enough grasp of Java and selenium and api automation as well but development looks way more difficult for me at the moment)

plus whole career trajectory will change where I’ll essentially have only 1 year of experience in development and 3 as sdet while competing with folks with 4-5 Years of complete development experience

1ne0zxa,.NET dev (5+ yrs) to Dynamics 365 – is it worth it?,"Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I could use some advice.
I’ve been working as a .NET web developer for a little over 5 years now, mostly on enterprise and government-type projects. I’d say I’m mid-level, maybe senior depending on the team. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck in my career. Moving toward a team lead role in .NET seems to require switching jobs, grinding harder technically, and pushing myself in ways I can’t really do right now for personal reasons.
A friend suggested I look into Dynamics 365. His reasoning was that it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication — which are actually strengths of mine. Plus, having a solid dev background might give me an edge compared to people who started directly in Dynamics.
I did a bit of research and it seems like the Dynamics market is growing and there’s a clearer career path (especially with certifications). I get that certs alone aren’t enough without real experience, but at least the path feels more structured than in my current track. I’ve also heard people say Dynamics can be “boring” or “not real programming,” but honestly, I’m fine with that — stability and problem-solving are more important to me now.
For context, I’m currently in a financially good job, so I’m not desperate to switch. But I don’t want to stay stagnant either.
So my questions are:
• Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?
• What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?
• Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?

1nei1rf,No AI learning arc,"Hi,

This post has the objective to ask a questions about this learning arc that I will do without using any AI, usually back in the day when people would learn how to program it would be straight into either C, Java or C++, there wasn't much abstraction and everything had the objective of working inside a terminal through console logs or any other objective.

A few moments ago I noticed one thing, we are getting more and more tools abstracted, I remember that a few years ago I learnt how to execute the same thing an array.push() method does but without the abstraction.   
  
Back in the day this helped me significantly understanding the why's of everything, it was such ingrained that usually I had everything hard coded(don't crucify me I was a child), without abstractions unless methods or classes got insanely huge.

Now to come back to the questions, since I am working once more on developing my thinking ability which I noticed got way worse, how would you approach it?

1nem54k,How to deal with an analyst whose job is slowly becoming more developer like without consent,"Hello,

I usually meet with one of our analysts daily to discuss a specific audit we’re running. I realized this one had a lot of crossover with my role, so I’ve been meeting with her regularly to review it and provide insights on what to look for. However, today I noticed that she has been stepping into the role of a developer a bit too much—specifically by running update statements herself.

That concerned me since she doesn’t have the experience to handle that. After talking with her more, it seems this is a recurring issue where she ends up fixing problems on her own. This is clearly a process failure; there needs to be a better way to get these changes addressed without analysts/auditors having to do it themselves.

I’m wondering if anyone here has experience with an analyst/developer joint team and how your teams handle this. Since this company is still fairly new and lacks some key processes, I’d like to learn how other firms manage it. I’m not her direct manager, but I would like to recommend some changes to help standardize this process.

1ne6kdq,How to break the ceiling in my region,"I'm living in eastern europe and currently making 100k$/yr working in a faang with 7yoe. It may sound like a lot of money for people in my country, but if you want to travel or live a quality life, it's not that much.

There is no way to break this skill/money ceiling while in my region, and I'm willing to relocate. I'm interested in both project difficulty/ intellectual satisfaction and money. I could get past the money ceiling by getting multiple freelance contracts that each pay 100k$/yr, but that would be just doing the same braindead work twice, instead of being paid twice for something twice as hard.

I had the chance to go to really good western universities (had class colleagues go to oxford/harvard), but due to multiple reasons including family and money issues decided to stay in my country.

I think that I'm at a pretty solid technical level to advance, but there are no opportunities here. I'm performing on par with my colleagues in the US (while not having any incentive to put in actual effort past not getting fired), but when I apply to jobs outside my country I don't get any callbacks, except from those wishing to exploit with low cost and shit projects.

I feel stuck and don't really know what to do. I can work in any EU country without a visa, but would require one for US. I feel like skill does not matter at all, and residence/nationality/school name are the only things that get people jobs in this industry.

I'm currently working on a research paper that has good potential to get me a top tier ML conference/journal, as I have already re-proven/discovered things published at that level (without having previously read about it), and putting all my effort and hopes into this opening some opportunities for me.

Transferring internally is not really an option, as 99% get rejected and even if you get to US, they will first put you in a shit team. So it's 1-2 years of constant overperformance in my region, then another 1-2 years of overperformance in a bad team in the US to then get to the starting line where opportunity would meet skill.

It feels insane that without a top tier conference, someone passionate and willing to improve their skills, has no chance to go past a ceiling just because of the place they were born in and where they studied, regardless of skill or potential.

1nds9r6,How to handle extreme scope creep in a junior QA role?,"I’m in my first QA role, hired as a Junior Software Tester with a focus on manual and some automation testing. Recently, scope creep has gotten out of hand.

For example, my CEO directly assigned me and another junior coworker a project that seems closer to building a customizable data visualization platform (dynamic schemas, user-defined tables, coplots, cross-filtering, etc.). This feels way beyond the scope of my role, my experience, and even my pay grade. We’ve been spinning our wheels with no guidance or training, and deadlines are looming.

I’m stuck between:
	•	Trying (and failing) to deliver something I don’t have the skillset for.
	•	Asking for clarification/support, which historically results in my CEO getting upset.
	•	Quietly job hunting (which I plan to do), but I still need to navigate this situation until I can leave.

My questions:
	•	For those of you who have been in similar positions, how do you handle scope creep when leadership has unrealistic expectations?
	•	Is there a professional way to push back without burning bridges?
	•	From a career development standpoint, should I attempt to stretch into this (even though I’m unqualified), or is it better to set boundaries and focus on finding a role that matches my job title/skills?

I've been working as an application developer in Toronto for around 7 years now, 1 year as an intern and 6 as an application developer at a mid sized insurance company.

A conversation with a coworker the other day made me realize that I am badly, *embarrassingly* underpaid and I am long passed due to move on from this company if I ever want to live a respectable life.

My role has been extremely (perhaps excessively) silod into Microsoft SQL Server (I'm essentially an ETL developer) for that time. While I am very confident in my SQL Server skills many of my other skills (C#, web dev, etc) have er... substantially atrophied - I would say back to a beginner level even.

So I know I need to reskill a bit but when I look at job adds I am finding myself a little bit... overwhelmed. It's all key word soup asking for half a dozen different technologies and it's really clear that they are not all equally important but as this is my first real position and I've been so heavily silod for so long I don't know how to parse which of these key words is actually likely to be important to the business operations of a given business.

I guess what it really comes down to is that I am looking for some advice on the path of least resistance here. For some one with strong SQL server skills and very little else, what technologies are likely to compliment the best?

Which skills are the necessities vs nice to have? Obviously I can say I'm not going to pivot into web development with this skill set, but I'm having a bit of trouble parsing how to get the best bang for my buck in terms of effort spent.

I just recently started a new job in a massive non-tech Fortune 500 firm.

I (TL) was given a team of devs that hardly know ui coding on a project that is a highly complex conversion of ETL processes with a small ui footprint.

The teams is oversized (7), the project is greenfield modernization with the only requirements being to figure out how the legacy app works. Meanwhile I have PO that does nothing, leaving me to do all story writing, code reviews, and then sit down with PO to say things are done.

My boss is not very involved…

I basically am drowning trying to get weak UI devs to do backend work and am getting pushed to go faster by the PO/PO boss.
I am teaching and setting up all prelim work to simplify work for my dev team, but the offshore crew just has no experience or willingness to problem solve. Overall I think we are moving just fine, but I will almost certainly burn out keeping things afloat on my own for a long period of time.

1ne1k0v,Very unique question that no one has ever asked before,"Hi everyone! I am here to ask a question which was asked lots of times - is it possible?

Little background: I am in my mid twenties, moved to the US couple years ago (legally if it is of concern) and I only do Delivery gigs to earn money. I don't have a completed bachelors degree (I was studying computer engineering), but I do have a background in web development. But ever since coming to the US I worked in a restaurant and now only resorting to gig works.

My question is, is it worth pursuing Cloud Engineering path in 2025? I am having very conflicting opinions about the market, and don't want to waste time if eventually it will not add up to something.

I am here to ask a question which was asked lots of times - is it possible?

Little background: I am in my mid twenties, moved to the US couple years ago (legally if it is of concern) and I only do Delivery gigs to earn money. I don't have a completed bachelors degree (I was studying computer engineering), but I do have a background in web development. But ever since coming to the US I worked in a restaurant and now only resorting to gig works.

My question is, is it worth pursuing Cloud Engineering path in 2025? I am having very conflicting opinions about the market, and don't want to waste time if eventually it will not add up to something. People in my situation are mostly got a job as a tester or QA engineers 1-2 years ago. Or is there any other paths you would recommend me to pursue?

I am uncertain because I enjoy both the technical and the interactive/design-focused aspects. At the same time, I am unsure about how AI development will affect different roles, and which education provides the strongest foundation for the job market. Working abroad has always been a dream, and it is one of the reasons I want to pursue a Master’s degree (both programs are taught in English).

One factor that influences my options is that I do not have a university-level mathematics background (only Mathematics 2b from high school, economics track). Many technical Master’s programs require more math, but these two do not.

* Which of these programs do you think provides the strongest foundation on the job market, both today and in the future?

1ncgjvi,"First dev job, struggling with unmaintainable React code","I’m an early-career frontend developer, and I’ve been at my first job (a startup) for about 10 months now.

First, I was assigned to work on a product that had quite a few bad practices - not type-safe, over a thousand TypeScript/linter errors, and a huge 10k+ LOC table component. With a lot of effort from me and my teammate, we managed to make it somewhat decent and easier to work with.

Apparently because I did a good job, I was thrown into another project that was built in-house, and honestly, I’m feeling extremely frustrated because it’s the same story all over again - the codebase is even harder to work with. Some examples:

* Massive 2k+ LOC React components
* Misuse of Context API for basically everything
* Features tightly coupled, imagine component with 10+ useEffects, sockets, table column definitions, 10 level deep ternary operators, and subtle differences depending on ""mode"" - reused like 20 times throughout the app, used to display completely different entities.
* Testing and modularization are basically nonexistent
* Unclear dependencies (Entity info modal depends on a 2k LOC Loads context and on a common state that is consumed by chat modal, which depends on a 2k LOC NewLoads context, etc...)
* This project is built on NextJS + It has a separate node backend. Why? Good question.

Honestly, it’s just incredibly bad.

I also position myself as a full-stack developer, so I took some tasks on the backend side - same story:

* 8k+ LOC controllers mixing validation, service, and repository logic
* Error handling? `res.status(500).json({ msg: ""Internal server error"" })` \- lol
* Not using prepared statements (hello SQLi)
* No pagination in a logistics app
* Why assign some common processed data into a shared variable, when you can just copy and paste the processing part.
* Copy-pasted logic with zero abstraction
* Lots of inconsistencies (e.g., phone field required in some places, optional in others)
* No tests and probably untestable - ZERO classes in a 100k LOC codebase

So, honestly, I am extremely frustrated. It feels like everything I learned about writing maintainable code is being wasted.

I’m considering leaving for a healthier codebase, but since this is my first job and I don’t have a formal CS degree, I’m worried about how it’ll look. I want to grow my skills, especially in maintainable React development, but I don’t want to feel stuck in this mess forever.

So my questions:

1. Is it reasonable to leave a first job after 10 months because the code is unmaintainable?
2. How do I frame this experience positively in interviews?
3. Any tips for surviving in such a codebase?

First, I was assigned to work on a product that had quite a few bad practices - not type-safe, over a thousand TypeScript/linter errors, and a huge 10k+ LOC table component. With a lot of effort from me and my teammate, we managed to make it somewhat decent and easier to work with.

Apparently because I did a good job, I was thrown into another project that was built in-house, and honestly, I’m feeling extremely frustrated because it’s the same story all over again - the codebase is even harder to work with. Some examples:

* Massive 2k+ LOC React components
* Misuse of Context API for basically everything
* Features tightly coupled, imagine component with 10+ useEffects, sockets, table column definitions, 10 level deep ternary operators, and subtle differences depending on ""mode"" - reused like 20 times throughout the app, used to display completely different entities.
* Testing and modularization are basically nonexistent
* Unclear dependencies (Entity info modal depends on a 2k LOC Loads context and on a common state that is consumed by chat modal, which depends on a 2k LOC NewLoads context, etc...)
* This project is built on NextJS + It has a separate node backend. Why? Good question.

Honestly, it’s just incredibly bad.

I also position myself as a full-stack developer, so I took some tasks on the backend side - same story:

* 8k+ LOC controllers mixing validation, service, and repository logic
* Error handling? `res.status(500).json({ msg: ""Internal server error"" })` \- lol
* Not using prepared statements (hello SQLi)
* No pagination in a logistics app
* Why assign some common processed data into a shared variable, when you can just copy and paste the processing part.
* Copy-pasted logic with zero abstraction
* Lots of inconsistencies (e.g., phone field required in some places, optional in others)
* No tests and probably untestable - ZERO classes in a 100k LOC codebase

1nd48ay,At cross roads with a decision,"At a crossroads

I’ve been working for about nine months post-grad as a product manager at Visa. It was the job I landed right after graduation, and I was open to either SWE or PM. Honestly, it’s been pretty calm overall. Early on, the work was very light, which is expected as a new hire but it’s picked up over time 

As a young PM in many companies you’re not really driving strategy or  business decisions (which was my main attraction) it’s more about handling day-to-day operations here and there which is fine but I also feel like you learn way more as a SWE early in your career as well and grow your skill set. Being a PM doesn’t necessarily grow any “hardcore” skills, more of managerial adjacent skills. Because of that, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to stay in PM right now and had already started prepping to get back into leetcoding to pursue a SWE role. It’s also generally easier to transition from SWE to PM than the other way around say trying to switch about again later on. 

Recently though, something unexpected happened. About two weeks ago, Google reached out to me regarding their APM program. I had applied last year (November 2024) and was rejected, but they asked if I was still interested and said they’d like to extend an offer. For anyone familiar with PM, this program is basically the elite of the elite for new grad PM roles, it doesn’t get much better than that. So now I’m overthinking the whole situation.

Im open to giving it more time, especially with a company like Google but If I go that route, it’s a full two-year program. By the time I’d finish, I’d be three years out of college, and if I then decided SWE was the better path, I’m not sure how realistic or appealing that switch would look after spending those 3 years in product. On the other hand, the magnitude of this opportunity is hard to ignore , it feels like a peak moment for me. I’m extremely grateful, and while this is definitely a good problem to have given the current economy, I’ve been struggling to think it all the way through. I’d really appreciate any thoughts


TL;DR: Been a PM at Visa ~9 months post-grad. Was leaning toward switching into SWE soon. Unexpectedly got an offer for Google’s APM program (elite 2-year PM track).

1nc4tl7,Is this good advice for a recent grad who didn't do internships?,"I'm a senior engineer (12 YOE), and a friend of the family's kid is a recent grad who, naturally, hasn't been able to land a job, given he didn't do any internships before graduating.  His dad asked me if there was anything I could do and I cringed, but told him to have the kid text me and I'd see what I could do to get him on track, but not to expect miracles.

My plan for advising him is to set expectations: not having any experience on his resume exiting college will make it impossible to land any engineering role in the current job market.  He probably needs to run a 3-year-long marathon to get where he wants to be.

I think his only shot is going to be a tech-adjacent role, probably helpdesk or support, but maybe a business analyst or junior product/project manager role if he is incredibly lucky.  Of course, he needs to continue applying to junior engineer openings on the off chance they give him an interview, for the experience of interviewing alone.

Even making these concessions, he needs to wrap his mind around 6 months to a year of applying everyday with nothing to show for it.  If his parents need him to contribute to the household, a McJob will be necessary to make ends meet.

While applying, I'd have him come up with a product.  It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, disruptive, profitable, or even revenue-generating.  What's important is that he build it from zero, and that the result is usable by some audience.  To build the product, I'd advise him to leverage AI the same way we used to leverage stackoverflow.  Once he ships an MVP, he can include it on his resume, but he needs to continue to iterate on it.

If he lands a eng-adjacent role, he needs to stay there for 2 years at least to avoid being labeled as a job-hopper.  Keep working on the side project, or kick off a new one.  Automate tasks at work with and without AI.

1ncv5de,Tips for New Grad Applications (2026)?,"Hello!

I'm currently finishing up my undergraduate in Computer Science, and I'll be graduating this upcoming Spring. With that being said, I've started my search for new grad positions, particularly related to Software Engineer/Development. I've done an internship search before, but I strongly feel like searching for an internship and a full-time position are two completely different processes. I'm under the impression that the interview process is much more difficult, and the stakes are higher as factors like relocation, salary, and the fact that you'll be spending at least the next 2-3 years of your life at this particular company, play a pretty big role in deciding where to apply. 

  
Now I don't live under a rock, I'm well aware of the fact that the market is really bad right now. Despite that, I would rather not indulge in the doom/gloom comments and posts. I know I'm going to have to work hard and put in lots of applications. 



I'm more of looking for tips when applying to new grad positions as this is completely new to me. Things like what should you look for in a new grad position? Where to look for them? What should we do to prepare for interviews? What makes you stand out as a candidate? Should I work on more personal projects? Should you be negotiating salaries? Things of that nature

  
I'll put this information here because I know someone will ask:

My stats:

* I have two internships under my belt
* I have a 3.2 GPA
* My school is ranked in the top 50 for engineering, so not the best but not the worst either

I've started neetcode 150, I hope to complete all of it before the end of fall semester. I'm currently using Handshake for most of my applications as I've had the most success with that platform in the past. I know Software Engineering is not the only route I can pursue with my degree, but I really do enjoy developing, and I don't think I could imagine doing a job that doesn't have that aspect in it. 

I'm also really curious about how you prep for other questions that leetcode doesn't necessarily prepare you for? Like there have been many technical questions I've been given in the past that I wasn't necessarily prepared for.

1nbzock,Need advice for getting an internship for summer of 2026,"Hey everyone,  
I’m a junior studying CS in NYC. I’m in a dual-degree program and expect to finish my bachelor’s around May 2026 and my master’s in 2027. I don’t go to a top-tier school.

* Research assistant with one of my professors
* IT internship at a medical company
* No software engineering internships yet
* No personal projects on my resume at the moment

I know I’m behind compared to people with multiple SWE internships or big personal projects. I’d like to get a software engineer internship this summer, doesn't need to be a big tech company just somewhere I can get good experience.

1nbyrwi,Weighing an offer - what are your thoughts?,"I recently interviewed for a level 4 position at a FAANG. Offer came in at:

Base: $193k
Equity: $75k per year
Sign-on bonus: $25k
Yearly bonus: 15%

Expected TC for year 1: ~$322,000

The job would be based in the bay area (so an expensive place to live).

My current role pays me $120,000 base w/ zero equity and almost 0 annual bonus.

My wife has a job that pays her $165,000 base and has about a 15% annual bonus. She gets some equity too, but I’m not sure the numbers.

So my wife and I together currently have a TC of about ~$310,000 or so.

If I take the FAANG offer, we will have to move which means my wife must quit her job. She will look for a new job, but we don’t know how long that search would take or what level she would end up at after finding a job. We also have 2 young kids (both under 5 years old).

The FAANG position would pay me much better than my current role, but it comes with risk:

(1) My wife will be out of a job for awhile
(2) FAANG layoffs happen all the time, and we would have to uproot our family and buy a house in the bay area. What if layoffs happen right after we move there? My current role - while paid much lower - is essentially guaranteed to not have layoffs (for at least another 2 years).

I also work remote right now, so with this FAANG company I’d be going in office.

1ncdoin,What’s my path to Staff+?,"Hi. I'm a dev with 8 years of experience. I currently work for a mid-size 'consulting' company. I'm in the Midwestern US.

A little about me and where my head is. I've held a 'senior SWE' title for the past 3 years at this company. Effectively, this means my company loans me out as a Senior SWE to large US-based companies for prolonged periods of time, where I work with their engineers on their product line(s).

Work falls into one of two scenarios: either their product is greenfield and needs a strong developer to lay down foundational code and infrastructure (after which point their FTEs take over maintenance and scaling), or their product has been in production for a sizeable length of time and is starting to show signs of instability due to significant technical debt, at which point I am hired to refactor a part of the system.

Over time I have had a taste of how several engineering organizations do things, and I have developed strong opinions about what is good/bad about those things. Naturally, as a contractor, I have little/no autonomy in driving org-level practice at the client.

I have however, at several clients, been able to win some say in how they do things, but that opportunity only came after I had demonstrated competence in their very broken environment (i.e. 'led without authority), and since I am a contractor, I never get to stick around long enough to see the long-term effects of my decisions first hand - I'm not given a chance to iterate. I either hear about the effects through the engineers I keep in touch with, or folks on the product side.

My manager has made it clear that life beyond the 'Senior IC' track at my current company means leaning more into the sales side than the delivery side (RFP development, marketing the company at conferences, etc.), which isn't in line with what I want. So, I need to find a place that will let me grow past 'Senior IC', but I don't know whether my current experience is strong enough to attract the attention of a company that will let me operate beyond the 'Senior IC' level.

1nbugcp,Need advice on AWS AI Practitioner & Associate exams – worth it for frontend dev career switch?,"Need advice on AWS AI Practitioner & Associate exams – worth it for frontend dev career switch?

Hey everyone,

I could use some guidance here.

My background:

Currently working as a frontend React developer with ~2.5+ years of experience.

I’ve done some projects with TypeScript, Next.js, GraphQL, Node.js/Express.

Long-term, I want to move toward full-stack or more preferable cloud oriented roles.

The situation:
I recently got a promotional offer from AWS:

50% off voucher for the AWS AI Practitioner certification.

On completing that exam, I’ll get another 50% off voucher, which I plan to use for an Associate-level exam (most likely Solutions Architect Associate).


Initially, I was actually planning to go with the Cloud Practitioner (CCP) → Associate route for the 50% discount voucher chain. But this AI Practitioner offer looks more attractive:

Because AI is the future, and even a basic cert might add some value.

Plus, I’d still get another 50% off voucher to use on Associate.


👉 Please correct me if I’m thinking about this wrong — is AI Practitioner worth doing over CCP, or is CCP still better as a base before Associate?

Questions I have:

1. At the associate level, which exam would make the most sense for me? (Solutions Architect Associate vs Developer Associate vs SysOps)

2. I don’t have much AWS exposure apart from the Cloud Practitioner course I did on Coursera (AWS official).

3. I also don’t want to spend too much time or money on certifications right now. How much time does it realistically take to prepare for:
    • AWS AI Practitioner
    • An Associate exam (especially Solutions Architect Associate)

4. Do you think it’s realistic to aim for clearing both by the end of October if I start now?

5. One more concern: since this AI Practitioner exam is already scheduled using a 50% promotional offer, will I still get another 50% voucher on passing? Or is that only valid if you pay full price? (Would love to hear from anyone who has actually tried this).


Why I’m doing this:
I’m still mainly targeting frontend developer jobs, but I want to leverage these certs to show I can contribute beyond just frontend — maybe cloud integration, full-stack awareness, and long-term growth potential.

Would really appreciate insights from folks who’ve taken these exams recently!

1nakc3f,Struggling to fit in in big tech - advice for hitting high performer goals?,"This isn’t a CS career question, but this subreddit is full of smart minds (please suggest another sub if there’s somewhere else to take this)!  I’m about 10 years into my engineering career; self-taught and came into Disney as a senior mobile engineer, then left after five years to join a big tech.  I came into big tech at a pretty high level role for an IC, which sometimes gets into my head that I have imposter syndrome.

Any job I’ve ever had in tech, I’ve been a high performer.  I got promoted at Disney after three months, highly unlikely because I’m any more skilled than anyone else (I’m definitely not), but probably I spent a weekend on a high-impact side project that was fun and had cross-functional impact, and I’m a good communicator.  I sort of coasted there, but big tech has been a gut punch.

I’m 6 months into my role at big tech and was rated as an underperformer.  Given that I came in at a high level, I have no doubt the expectations were high, but I think I’m doing my best.  I say yes to a lot (often a curse), take on whatever is asked of me, and try to push through learning complex systems and very frequent uncertainty of what I should be doing every day.

1nat9i8,Should every Behavioural Question be Answered in STAR?,"Hopefully this is the right subreddit to ask this.  
  
Hey, have an interview coming up at Microsoft for an internship.

What do you do when you have a disagreement with someone on your team?  
How do you help a client figure out what they want when they’re not sure?  
Tell me about how you balance deadlines with day-to-day responsibilities

\- my question for all of these questions is:  
Should I just respond back with how I do something or what I do?  
Or should I coming up with a scenario where I did that?

1nb1rfh,Am I ready for newgrad? Am I cooked?,"I attend a T50 school, and am graduating this upcoming spring. My only internship ever, despite hundreds of applications, was this early stage startup which didn't even pay me and which I haven't gotten a return offer. I've also had unpaid contractor experience with a few companies, as well as a research position at my university. Won't broadcast my current resume publicly for the sake of privacy, but it basically features a brief overview of education and certification, the above-mentioned experiences, 2 overhyped school projects, and a list of skills. People I've shown my resume to have told me that it's neat, well-formatted, impressive, etc.

Near the end of last year I was actually getting a few interviews and speaking with real managers (about 1 per month on average). But seeing as I no longer qualify for most internships and have to apply to much more cutthroat full-time pipelines, I feel like my fortune is about to end, and things are only going to be uphill from here. During my search, I've often encountered a bunch of jobs that seem to be easy or entry level, but then require 6 or 8 years of experience that might not be overlooked as easily now vs. 5-10 years ago.

I've never actually had any sort of technical interview ever (unless you count an easy single-question thing I had for an internship), though that could just be because I've mainly been applying to SWE-adjacent roles rather than pure SWE. I can do *some* LeetCode, but I feel like if I were to receive a technical interview, I'd fail instantly. I feel like I'm woefully underskilled, and don't have enough experience in a lot of the specific technologies I've been selling myself with on my resume.

The ceiling just seems hopelessly high, and I'm seriously concerned that I won't be able to secure a job. I'm concerned that I'm doomed to a hopeless eternity of shuttling between my conservative parents' house and a local fast-food joint. People online give me the idea that there are a zillion paper-pushing starter jobs around every other office looking for anyone who has any kind of degree, but 1) there seem to be fewer thanks to AI, 2) I might need to dumb down my resume to an extent to avoid getting flagged as a job hopper, and 3) the cost of living literally everywhere not in the middle of nowhere is so insane.

Some options I'm considering, or not:

- referrals and stuff: don't always help and don't guarantee anything, especially below a directorate, presidential, or executive level

- a Master's or a PhD: would help me better qualify for data science and AI roles, but since money's short ideally I'd work a more entry-level job and do something online or locally in the meantime. But I'd need an entry-level job in the first place, of course.

- pivoting to IT; getting the appropriate certs: seems like a noble goal, especially cybersecurity which I hear is booming. But presently I have 0 cybersecurity experience whatsoever, and I think it's gonna be real humiliating when even after acquiring 3-4 certs, I struggle to break into even menial help desk roles that pay $15/hr. And I heard the IT job market is even more brutal than the CS job market.

- pivoting to nursing or the trades: my parents literally laughed at me when I suggested doing this, though I suspect that they'd be offended deep down, seeing as they've paid my entire tuition.

- delaying graduation: may raise scrutiny nowadays, could waste money, and might as well do grad school at that point.

TL;DR I just feel like a failure.

1nagcaa,Unsure of where to transition (from QA),"So i'll preface by saying I am very lucky to have a job, and i'm not planning on leaving it anytime soon.

I've tried networking, coffee chatting and writing personalized messages to seniors on LinkedIn. I still get auto-rejected even with referrals. It's so crushing when I still haven't had an opportunity to talk to a HUMAN after all of this time.

1nan8qv,how do i actually use twitter for career and growth as a dev?,"i've been using twitter for like 6 months now but still can't figure out how to actually get anything useful from it  
most of what i see daily is just:

1. random ragebait
2. drama about tools or frameworks
3. people simping for big tech and companies
4. endless course drops pdfs and ""free"" stuff
5. posts like i bought mac what to install
6. and more more more more posts which i find no value in it.

i thought maybe i should start posting too since my profile is still empty but i'm a beginner so half the time i feel like i don't know what i'd even post  
but then i see so many people using twitter to grow their careers make connections or just learn cool stuff and i’m like how lol

not trying to go viral or anything just wanna use it in a way that helps me grow as a dev and maybe build some kind of network

most of what i see daily is just:

1. random ragebait
2. drama about tools or frameworks
3. people simping for big tech and companies
4. endless course drops pdfs and ""free"" stuff
5. posts like i bought mac what to install
6. and more more more more posts which i find no value in it.

i thought maybe i should start posting too since my profile is still empty but i'm a beginner so half the time i feel like i don't know what i'd even post  
but then i see so many people using twitter to grow their careers make connections or just learn cool stuff and i’m like how lol

not trying to go viral or anything just wanna use it in a way that helps me grow as a dev and maybe build some kind of network

1na7hn6,should i switch roles? Or im just thinking the grass on the other side is more green but it's not?,"i have a degree in cmputer engineering and due to the market state, i ended up working as a data analyst. Luckly our team is so little that i ended up working as data engineering too, working on pipelines, and more tech thing. But i've noticed that i really hate building dashboards, providing data, changing color to a google sheet column because seems like who works in sales doesnt have enough brain to do it themselves

Sometimes in our company we have a big data meetings where one time, some of them started to show off their amazing and beautiful dashboards and how it works and i was puking

when i was in university, for example, for exam, my professor wrote a library for a medical software to help surgeons analyze the data from the patient brain and decide how to operate. the library helps with a specific type of file and helps to visualize stuff. My exam was to add new features on it. I liked where i spent time on the doc reading how classes and its methods works and which one to use. and slowly working on the new features and finally see my baby born, ready to production

instead if another sales person ask me to move the chart to another place, and add more pie chart im gonna lose my mind

  
so i would like to ask people who started like me and transition into data science (working on ML models like things in kaggle) or data engineering, or better into software engineering like fullstack or anything else

1n8zdbs,I made a terrible mistake,"I left my old job a few weeks ago because I was frustrated with the lack of growth and the salary not even keeping up with inflation. I jumped into what looked like a safer and more stable position. The onboarding was smooth and everyone was friendly but then reality hit me on day one.

The department I joined is basically one guy and now me. The entire workflow is a storm of spreadsheets and manual emails. I realized almost immediately that the whole thing could be automated with a few scripts and dashboards. What currently takes a week could be done in a couple of hours. Which means the existence of the department itself is hanging by a thread.

Here is the catch. To actually automate I would need direct access to the system and that access has to go through my boss. Doing it on my own is impossible without going through him, and going through him means making myself a direct threat to his role and survival.

On top of that, in just two days of onboarding I was already dumped with actual work, despite only having the most superficial understanding of their processes and tools. The approach was basically “just figure it out.” There is no documentation at all, and to make it worse the processes themselves are arbitrary. One client gets handled one way, another client gets handled completely differently, with no clear rules or references for why things change. It feels random, improvised, and fragile.

To make things worse the company has its own AI and digital transformation division. If they ever notice what is really going on, they could easily absorb or eliminate this function. Which leaves me in a place where my job is both fragile and painfully boring.

Now I feel stuck. If I leave too soon my résumé will show a disastrous short stay and I will look unreliable. If I stay I risk wasting my time in something that feels pointless and might get axed anyway. Right now my plan is to keep my head down for a while and later reframe the story as “I improved and automated processes and then decided to move toward project or team management because there was no further path in that role.”

1n952nf,How to work with highly motivated engineer?,"Im a mid-level engineer who got a new job this year. I was just given my first big project and am working with another mid-level engineer who has been here for about 2 years. We are both working under a PE who is leading the project. 

We have distributed the work and at the start I was wrapping up some bug fixes that my manager asked me to complete. The other mid-level im working with is a really nice guy and he is really motivated which I like. The problem is he is almost too motivated to the point that he has just started coding like crazy and in the first week did some of the work on my plate. I've seen him push code on the weekends at like midnight. One time I asked him if he works onthe weekends and he says sometimes he's bored at home and watches tv and code. I politely let him know that we should work together and I dont want him to feel like he did everything. So he backed off some of my stuff a bit. 

But throughout the project, it seems he is going 150% towards any little changes that need to be added. If we need to add a change, he has just added it. Since he has been here for 2 years, he knows which people to go to outside of us 3 for questions and a few times I heard he had a few meetings with people to discuss things, so i asked him to keep me included as well and to give me any resources of people in case I had questions. He has done better of doing that but a few times forgot to send me some useful stuff.  I was gone for a couple days and in those days he made some major changes. Again I think it's great, but now it feels like the whole code is practically his (maybe 70% of it) and the PE has noticed and even in meetings will talk more to him and say (let's call my co-worker mike for the example) ""Mike can you write a note and make that change"". Barely has directed me. 

I feel like I have to step in and say ""ill make this change"" or make it clear that ill do the change. I feel like anything I have discovered ill reach out to him and let him know but I can tell that when it comes to visibility it looks like he's doing 90%. He has done more but I think it's more like 60%-70%. I dont think Mike really is doing this to be spiteful or anything I just think he's one of those people who is just really motivated and just starts and doesnt stop. Again, i think that's great and it definetely has kept me in my feet but I also feel like im getting pushed out. 

I should say that I got laid off from my last job before I got this job and i think a reason for it was because I was slightly a more passive engineer and I feel like this could be held against me that Mike did 70% of the work and it may look like I was lazy on this project.

I have knowledge in:

- frontend stuff with Tailwind & all the latest ui shit
- know how to use Figma + basic logo designing.
- databases (used to them since high school)
- languages like JS, TS, Java, Python
- Have done a bit of LC (still doing)
- basic backend like node/express, python/fastapi, know basic of auth (with jwt & firebase auth, but still learning).
- Have very basic knowledge in docker (like I know what it is, and how to set things up).
- Have basic knowledge in security stuff like input validation, parameterized queries, hashing and salting, etc.
- I also know how to prompt properly + detect if AI is BSing (nowadays people seem to ask that as well, might as well learn it, so I did).

1n9xqe8,How to Secure a Real Internship Certificate in My Situation?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 4th-year Computer Engineering student, and I’m facing a really difficult situation with my college placement process. My college recently introduced a rule where only students who have completed an internship are allowed to sit for placements in top companies. Unfortunately, this rule is new, and I haven’t been able to secure an internship yet, despite trying a lot. The college is strict about genuine internships and doesn’t entertain scam ones.

Here’s the problem: I’m due for eye surgery in October due to damage to my retina from an extremely bad accident I had. Fortunately, I didn’t lose my vision, but the injury has caused some ongoing issues, and there's a risk I could lose my vision permanently. After the surgery, I won’t be allowed to use any electronic devices for one month, which makes it impossible for me to complete any internship or even work remotely during that time.

On top of this, when I told my girlfriend about the situation, she broke up with me. She was aware of the accident and the risk to my vision, but hearing that it could still get worse was too much for her. I’m really struggling with both my health and personal life right now. 😭

With the internship requirement in place at my college, I’m now in a difficult spot. I won’t be able to complete any internship because of my medical situation, and I’ll be focused on my exams in November as well. This means I’ll miss out on any chance of securing an off-campus internship or part-time work during this time.

Is there any way to get a legitimate internship certificate without actually completing the internship, or any advice on how I should proceed?

I would really appreciate any guidance or suggestions. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’m grateful for any help.

1n8il9w,How come no one is talking seriously about replacing management with AI?,"Every time I see people mention it, it always seems like a joke. However, when you think about it, it makes more sense than replacing ICs. Think about it, why do we have so many layers of management in an organization? It's because one person realistically can't keep track of so many people reporting information to them, so instead they have managers report to them all the way up the chain...

This is where AI comes in. Instead of ICs reporting to managers, they just all report to the AI. Hell, the AI doesn't even need to be reported to because it already knows what everyone has been doing due to monitoring everyone's computers. All the CEO or board of directors needs to do is ask for updates from the AI. They can get very detailed information or high level overviews. No more time wasted on useless 1 on 1s, you just ask the AI how you could do better or the AI will automatically give you feedback or put you on PIP if needed based on a standard set of criteria, so no bias.

That solves one problem that is faced by large organizations, but how about another one? Think about all the time spent in meetings between managers to only come up with stupid decisions because normally the loudest voice will just win out and it isn't always the smartest. Instead, the AI can interact directly with the SMEs to assess all the information available and make the most informed decisions. Think of the time savings!

In conclusion, I think we are headed for a time where mid management will no longer exist. A near flat org mostly run by AI will be the most efficient corporate structure and will out compete all of the competition. Boards of directors will be forced to implement this type of structure because otherwise they will be failing their shareholders.

1n9jthx,Career Change from Game Dev Art - Need Advice,"Hi all,

I am currently considering OMSCS (or similar CS/IT MS program) and wanted to gather some advice from people in the program and/or industry.

**My background**

I have a BFA from a top art school where I majored in film and animation. Since I graduated 6 years ago, I have worked as a 3D artist doing primarily AR/VR stuff and most recently worked as an Environment Artist at a AAA studio. However, now I am looking for a career change. Not because I don't like what I do, in fact I love it. But because the Games industry job market is beyond volatile right now. I have been out of full-time work for nearly a year and the future of the industry feels uncertain.

I took one game coding course in college and have done game coding in my free time (primarily GScript for Godot). I also have done a tiny bit of Python a few years ago to write custom scripts for Maya.



**My question**

I am looking into CS/IT because it is a world that I am tangentially familiar with and interested in. My questions are as follows, some are more stupid than others -- feel free to answer as many or as few as you like:

1. How much prior knowledge of CS does this course require? Am I out of my depth?
2. Would you recommend the SWE industry?
3. Is the SWE industry as bad as the Games industry right now? Do many graduates have trouble finding work?
4. I see many posts of people completing this course while actively working a tech job. By not having previous professional experience, am I setting myself up for failure in the course and the job market afterwards?
5. Do you have any other advice?

Did you turn down offers due to lower pay? Did employers mention reasons for the pay reduction?



I'm wondering if this is tied to market conditions, remote work policies, or increased automation.

I want to take my shot at the techpreneur dream, but how important is a CS degree to do this in 2025?

For context, I vibe-coded an AI-personalized version of Google Classroom over the summer. I do have ~4 years of React experience, but no understanding of DSA beyond the fundamentals.

I do understand that my working MVP isn't the same as the real thing - I'd need CS skills to scale the website from one user to millions, make sure the website doesn't crash, make smart decisions regarding latency and databases, etc. But is it reasonable to assume that vibe-coding/React dev experience is enough to get a company to the point where I can hire specialists or a CTO to continue scaling?

From the curriculum I've seen, Informatics has some genuinely useful topics like design principles, market research, building user-first, etc. Meanwhile, my college CS friends complain that the stuff they're learning is too abstract/theoretical, and the job market isn't exactly hot either.

1n9q1wl,Realistic pathway to (possibly) break into tech?,"I understand that the current job market for CS grads is pretty miserable, and I do have a backup plan in case it doesn’t work out, but ideally I’d really like to get into tech.

My story: I graduated from a top-ranked public school with nearly a 4.0 GPA and a Poli Sci BA. I took some coding classes at my first university (a top-ranked private one in a big city that I ended up transferring out of) and really loved them but couldn’t get a CS major and graduate on time based on my transfer credits. I knew even at this point that I should have gone into CS. I was doing a weird program at my first school and couldn’t have gotten a CS major there either, though.

I ended up working at an AI company (basically training bots, although this was a much less sophisticated version of AI), doing an A/V support job, then moving abroad and getting a CS teaching certificate. I was thinking I could eventually branch into actual CS somehow with that credential but struggled more than expected (I had some personal stuff going on) and ended up returning back to the US. I then started working as an elementary TA and transferred my license over so I’m certified to teach CS here. Teachers are treated even worse in the US however than they were abroad, and I don’t want to teach high school again. 

I’ve been doing AI training on various platforms specializing in coding tasks since I have enough experience to qualify for them and can code well enough to pass the assessments. This pays extremely well compared to my TA role but there’s no stability or real career growth, plus I don’t want to train AI to replace programmers. I’ve also been working on LeetCode.

I want to actually break into CS somehow, but I ultimately don’t have a CS degree or any actual CS experience.

1n9rkg9,Layoff in My Late 40s – Reflecting on a global IT career and beyond,"# A Bit About Me

* Over 25 years in the dynamic world of IT, working across diverse platforms, tools, and technologies. Lived and worked (and paid income tax) in a dozen countries across three continents, with longest stints in the US, Canada, UK, Switzerland, Europe and India.
* I was into “thought leadership” for a period of time, authored/ penned numerous articles and whitepapers published in journals ranging from IEEE and Cutter IT Journal to popular magazines.  Experienced waves of outsourcing, offshoring, insourcing, and Global Capability Centers
* Most of my career was in *Corporate IT*, with a strong belief in being a Free Agent even while working for large enterprises. My longest tenure was with Infosys — with assignments in US, Canada, Europe. I started as a mainframe developer before Y2K days - hands on in MVS, JCL, DB2 CICS, IMS. BTW, these technologies are still around in some MNCs Then I moved on to Windows SDK - google that. And then Java Apps and bit of ERPs - JDE & Peoplesoft focused on data and integrations
* I’ve played almost every role in IT -  support, business analysis, business partnering, project and delivery management, systems ownership, and more; except perhaps system administration roles.
* I have learnt to grow and thrive as an “individual contributor”. Though I’ve led teams (most recently as an IT Director managing a BI/DW platform with 25+ reports), I chose to return to my forte, Enterprise architecture - working closely with board stakeholders and a smaller team. Most recently, I served as Senior Enterprise Architect, responsible for architectural integrity of 200+ platforms across APAC, spanning 12+ countries, with key markets in Japan, Australia & New Zealand, and Southeast Asia.

# The Layoff

My recent layoff wasn’t unexpected—more anticlimactic given the writing had been on the wall for months. My manager, the Regional VP, and I were let go together.

Survival in large organizations hinges on riding the waves of change—not just technical shifts but organizational transformations. Over 5.5 years, I navigated four major internal transformations, each bringing new reporting lines, teams, and stakeholders. When the Senior Director I worked with was laid off a year after I joined, it became clear that the IT culture here was a cycle of: hire, ride changes, then fire. Every new CIO, CFO, or CxO wanted to leave their mark, and “organizational transformation” inevitably affected headcount. It was only a matter of time before I was next.

The severance package was modest—a couple of months of “garden leave,” severance pay, gratuity, and three months of outplacement coaching and consulting.

This wasn’t my first layoff. As a consultant, many ended with contracts not renewed, and I simply moved on to new clients or accounts.

# What’s Next?

I have taken time to reflect and started by reviewing my personal balance sheet and cash flow. I often advise my mentees on work-life balance and fiscal prudence, and I try to follow this advice myself. While I haven’t made extraordinary gains from investments, compounding has worked fairly well. I’ve avoided debt and have paid off mortgage. Son is ready to go to college soon and I have saved up for that too. Of course, without a “social security” net and with long-term health uncertainties ahead, savings could diminish over time.

This will be my 3rd job-switch in my 40s, though it comes at a time the market is terrible. Current pursuits include:

* **Personal Project:** The timing of this layoff is somewhat fortunate. It has given me the opportunity to untangle a long-standing Gordian knot: unlocking the documentation around a parcel of land my father bought years ago that has been stuck in bureaucratic red tape.
* **Mentoring:** Focusing on life coaching and mentoring professionals on work-life balance beyond just career guidance.
* **Consulting:** Spending some time on change management for a transformation at a former employer, though I am not yet ready to return to 60+ hour workweeks.
* **Unlearning & Re-learning:** In my previous role, I helped roll out an internal GPT-based platform after months of effort in consulting, data integration, and training. A key lesson was educating users about what AI can and cannot do, demystifying the hype around AI/ML/GPTs. While some concerns about AI impacting jobs are valid, it’s important to separate hype from reality. I continue to delve into this vast area to see where it takes me

# Bottom Line

For those in their 40s looking to switch jobs, it’s **not impossible** if you dig into your network and hustle smartly. For those just starting out, think of an IT career as a long marathon—pace yourself rather than treating it as a short sprint.

1n8zjmh,Need advice on whether to trust Wipro Elite training offer or accept placement portal jobs,"Hello everyone,



I joined a Java training class in September 2024 where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Spring Boot, and React. The class has a placement portal with these key rules: unlimited interviews until placed, you can reject one offer but rejecting a second offer revokes portal access. Placement assistance ends on October 5, 2025.



I applied to Wipro Elite early 2025 via Superset, completed assessments, and received a Letter of Intent in July. Wipro’s training starts sometime in Q3 (Oct-Dec), followed by onboarding. I am confident I will pass training, which is usually the cause for revocation.



My class instructor said once training starts, I can share my LOI with him to freeze my placement portal status, allowing me to reapply if Wipro doesn’t work out. However, I’m uncertain if the training start will be late in Q3, and if the instructor or placement team will wait that long given pressure to reduce unplaced students.



This leaves me with two options:



Trust Wipro fully, wait for training and onboarding, which may take time and is uncertain.



Focus on placement portal jobs that may be less desirable, but offer quicker placement before the October cutoff.



What would you recommend in this situation? How long does Wipro usually take to onboard post-training? Is it wise to hold out for Wipro or secure an earlier offer?

I’m 37, a military retiree, and making a career change. I’m a rising sophomore at a community college in Eastside Seattle, working toward a BS in CS. This will be my third undergrad degree (Kinesiology and Biology, one from a military academy with significant networking benefits).

1. I’m open to CS-adjacent paths (IT, cybersecurity, data science, computer engineering, etc) if prospects are better.

1n9blw3,"Chose my own path, now regret it. Should I join my brother in web dev or keep pushing app dev?","Hey everyone,  
I’m 20 and in the last year of my BCA (from a 3rd-tier college in India). No campus placements, no proper opportunities — honestly, the job market looks brutal. On top of that, I’ve been feeling like I completely messed up my choices.

My brother works in web dev + web design and earns a good package. When I started college, he gave me the freedom to explore my own path instead of just following his. He didn’t want me to live in his shadow. So, I went on my own route, trying to “find my passion.”

It’s been 2 years. And now I feel like I wasted time. If I had just followed him back then, I’d probably already be earning or at least have skills lined up. Instead, I’m here, doubting myself and stuck in regret.

I don’t know if I’ll even do good in his line of work. Honestly, I feel embarrassed — like I was scamming everyone these 2 years, saying “I’m studying,” but deep down knowing I wasn’t really getting anywhere. If I now enter his field, he’ll see how little I know and how I basically wasted the last 2 years in uncertainty.

And it’s also not easy to just tell him *“hey, now I want to do what you do”*. I don’t even know if I’ll be able to pull it off, or if he could realistically get me freelance work or jobs. That thought itself feels heavy.

For context:

* In 1st year, I didn’t do anything major — just exploring different things without direction.
* In 2nd year, I started taking things more seriously and chose app dev. It was actually fun to build stuff, and I liked it, but it never felt like *this is my passion, I’ll do this for a living*. It was just… good and fun.
* I also liked that app dev felt less crowded compared to web dev.

I don’t know if I’m making the right choice or just setting myself up for another round of regret.

**TL;DR:** 20 y/o BCA student. Wasted 2 years exploring, no campus placements, regret not following my brother into web dev earlier. Tried app dev, fun but not passion. Now feel embarrassed, behind, and scared of making the wrong choice again. Looking for blunt advice.

* I also liked that app dev felt less crowded compared to web dev.

I don’t know if I’m making the right choice or just setting myself up for another round of regret.

**TL;DR:** 20 y/o BCA student. Wasted 2 years exploring, no campus placements, regret not following my brother into web dev earlier. Tried app dev, fun but not passion. Now feel embarrassed, behind, and scared of making the wrong choice again. Looking for blunt advice.

I know I don't really have any leverage, but is it worth it to negotiate? Given the context, I don't want to upset my manager given how he says he fought for this.

the company just had a spectacular Q2 (although that probably doesn't matter). Not sure what to even say tbh.

I had no issue with Bob, he was great to work with. As soon as he was converted he's been going above and beyond to extreme measures where its creating a toxic workplace and I feel the manager is taking advantage of it.

The PM lead is also decent but he expects alot sometimes in unreasonable times. Now back to Bob. As soon as he was converted to a full timer he's done things like logging in late at night at home and pushing PR's and sending teams messages in multiple channels showing off that he's online even at home and on the weekends.

1n8a9tp,Have a cyber security job offer with a space startup that I’m really torn on. Advice needed,"
Hey guys, so I’ll lay out the raw info first.

Company:
6+ years active
Has contracts with US military
23+ employees

Me:
2+ years cyber security analyst
7+ years tech experience
Have CISSP (just got last Wednesday!)

So, here’s the situation: I applied for a job with this company, and they sent me an offer! Great, right? Well, the position is “IT and cybersecurity specialist” and they specifically want me to handle a lot of their IT infrastructure. Servers, networks, device deployment. Basically a one stop shop for IT services. And honestly, I’m okay with that. I have a varied background and it could be fun! They also offer unlimited PTO and a flexible work schedule, as well as a hybrid work schedule. And yeah, I know the “unlimited PTO” scam, but they say they’ve never declined anyone and as for my part I’m willing to deal with it if necessary.

However, after two rounds of interviews, I had a realization: part of my job requires being in a physical space close to a server (within an hour radius) which is why it’s a hybrid position. I figured “okay, cool” but then I realized: since there are no set work hours, I’m pretty much on the hook for that server 24/7 as the only IT guy. So, I scheduled a meeting to discuss my concern with the founder and told him that sometimes I can be up to 5 hours away on the weekends (I like traveling and have a girl I’m sweet in in Montreal, lol). He informed me that the job would require me to communicate to him anytime I leave an hour distance from the server, so they could arrange to have backup present. But in the only IT guy. Technically he’s a director of IT but he’s only wearing the hat because it’s a startup.

So yeah. I’m worried that I’ll be unable to go anywhere if I take this job, and a little upset they didn’t bring that requirement up sooner (I went through two rounds of interviews over like a month lol)

Normally I’d just walk because of the bad vibes I’m getting, but they pay is quite good. I’m currently making 75k, and they’re offering 140k. It’s really hard to turn that money down, even though I just got the CISSP and I imagine more opportunities will present themselves.

So, thoughts?

I'm an intern, on week 2 - this week - today, I was given this absolutely questionable codebase, the BE server returns from boolean to string to array to json value, you never know what value type it will return and it's a nightmare to navigate because there is no documentation, there is nothing, the only way you gonna know is to print the result out. There is a log system, EVERYTHING is log in ONE PLACE, the tiniest thing is also logged, 1 request = a massive file containing every single log possible.

Furthermore, each request goes through 2 BE, 1 is the BE server and the other is a low-code platform server BE, and ts suck nuts, because this low-code platform has a request limit and the server is running on an unstable docker image so when either of these thing crashes, you don't know which thing crashed because the person who coded this before me thought it was a good idea to return EVERY SINGLE ERRORS MESSAGE AS ONE and there is no try-catch block.

Oh yeah, btw, I'm just an intern but I control the entire live production server of this project, this project doesn't have a development environment, I was tasked to research the dev environment + on top of maintaining abomination codebase + on top of developing new feature, I can literally use \`rm -rf\` this entire server.

So, today I was asked to fix a core function of the BE server, this BE server was created solely for this function. I was able to mitigate it by creating more sessions but this approach was rejected because all sessions have been approved by the client superiors and there is no way to change it and I CAN'T CHANGE THE FUNCTION to fix this because the function is ""working correctly"" based on the customer requirements by my lead, mind you guys although I am alone on this project, I do not received any documentations not even the customer/client requirements.

Oh and this job is below minimum wage in my country, I made triple being at mcdonald 

After the synopsis, I have a few questions or I need advices:

1. Should I quit? Because I do have a better option which is an official employee title and a museum gig which I like

2. If I don't quit? Where should I even start because while I have access to a lot of things, I don't have access to other things",6,0.62,18,2025-09-04 07:04:06,Vegetable_Echo2676,Student,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n808lf/as_an_intern_i_was_given_an_abomination_of_a/,True,0,False,False,7,Thursday,2025-09-04,2025-09,2.5714285714285716,11.16,"As an intern I was given an abomination of a codebase with no docs and no guidance.

1n7ghxu,"Got an offer, a welcome meeting with the manager and then an email saying they were wrong","I got a message on LinkedIn from my former boss saying that there was a position in his team and that he'd like me to apply. He said the work is good and the company pays well, and I really liked working with him so I decided to apply because I'd like to work with him again and I've been looking for something with better pay anyway.

I started the process with a interview with HR, than interview with the director of the company in my country, then technical interview with one of the people in the team, another interview with one of the main managers but now from the US. A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer.  I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a ""welcome to team"" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. 

I waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were ""waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer"", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes ""Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you"". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying ""hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?"". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). 

So... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a ""misstep"" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. 

Now... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like ""oh actually, forget that"" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already... I know they're a real company because I've checked several places and I know two people who work there (my former boss, and another person from a previous company I worked at), but doesn't this feel kinda scammy and all over the place? What would you do?

Honestly, this trying to find something better has been so exhausting... It's either no answers at all, a lot of scams (got offered a ""job"" to pose as another developer while said developer would be working on something else which is basically, well, fraud) or a complete mess like this case.

TL:DR: went through the whole process of interviews, got an offer from the company, a welcome meeting asking me what laptop I'd prefer to then getting an email three weeks later saying there was ""misstep"" in the process and the offer was not valid and that I need another round with live coding on Hackerrank and interviews again.",65,0.94,24,2025-09-03 17:35:13,BananaBerryPi,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n7ghxu/got_an_offer_a_welcome_meeting_with_the_manager/,True,0,False,False,17,Wednesday,2025-09-03,2025-09,0.36363636363636365,22.56,"Got an offer, a welcome meeting with the manager and then an email saying they were wrong I got a message on LinkedIn from my former boss saying that there was a position in his team and that he'd like me to apply.

1n89lxv,How deep one need to go for technologies/tools for placement and internship for on campus and off campus,"I’m trying to prepare for placements and internships, and one thing that constantly confuses me is how deep I actually need to go into different tools and technologies. With data structures and algorithms it feels a bit clearer since I can measure progress by solving problems, but when it comes to things like web development basics or Python libraries, I don’t know where to draw the line.

For example, if I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, should I go really deep into every feature or just enough to build small projects? Similarly, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or OpenCV, do I need to master all the functions or just focus on the most commonly used ones for projects?

I often feel stuck between wanting to learn everything in depth and worrying that I’m wasting time instead of moving forward. Right now I’m solving easy problems in DSA, but I also want to explore the tools needed for projects and resume building. The real struggle is figuring out how much is “enough” for placements, both on campus and off campus.

I also have only 2 months left to prepare, which makes it even harder to decide how much time to spend on each tool versus focusing on problem-solving practice.

So my question is .....how do you know when to stop going deep into a tool or technology and move on to the next one?

1n7ld7l,I no longer know what job title I best fit and would love some help.,"I've had a very eclectic, non-traditional career path, but now I'm at the point where I no longer know how to market myself. I've been interested in and learning how to write code since I was a teenager (currently in my mid thirties.) I've always done little dumb projects for myself, especially after reading Automate the Boring Stuff a while back.  I've picked up a lot of skills in a variety of tech adjacent things along the way: python (django and flask too), javascript, react, typescript, postgres, nosql, a ton of different AWS services (and less experience but still some with both GCP and Azure), cybersecurity, devops, and more.

I'm currently doing freelance full stack development in Typescript and Python, building an MVP of a web app for a client. I've been doing freelance dev work since being laid off last year, and off and on for the last decade. I like the freedom, but I'd really prefer to work at an early stage startup again (as long as their funded properly), but I don't know how to properly communicate all of my different skills. 

When I apply to jobs, I almost never hear back from places when I play for engineering roles, and I think it's due to not having many actual software engineer titles. Usually, If I'm applying to jobs and not hearing back, I fall back to applying to customer service roles. One of my managers will eventually realize I've got a ton of technical skills (usually because I'll build some tool or automate something), and I'll get promoted, but not usually to a dedicated tech team (with the exception of my last role, going to the data engineering team.)    
  
As an example, at my last job, I started as a technical support analyst and within a month has been given access to their github, prod db, and AWS (early stage startup that wasn't handling edge cases in customer order data, but also wasn't fixing it, so I did.) That snowballed to me building a bunch of internal tools for the customer service team that were previously only able to be handled by the backend engineers, and eventually becoming a data engineer. 

  
At another job, I was hired as a customer service rep and saw how tedious a monthly compliance report was to create, so I built an ETL pipeline in python (without knowing it at the time) that turned a 3 day ordeal into a 20 minute gut check. 

  
I'm great at root cause analysis, designing a fix, and implementing it (with consent from the appropriate teams). I've never come across a topic/skill that I can't quickly learn, but also have no issue asking questions on things I'm confused about. I'm good at seeing gaps that aren't being addressed that directly effect the QoL of individual workers and love helping make my co-workers lives easier. 

I also have severe ADHD, which hasn't been great for interviews. I've only ever had one live coding interview go well, the rest I start to make increasingly dumb mistakes and then go totally blank. I excel at take home tests, but even when I move along in the interviews on those, I end up losing out to someone with a more traditional background.

Work closely with stakeholders on requirements

Also do some data science work (feature engineering, modeling support, ML research)

1n77uwy,Would a Reasearch assistant position make me more hireable?,"I'm starting my 4th year of uni and I've been working full time for a big non-fanng EU corporation for 9 months now. The tech stack is good (Spring + integration with hyperscalers) and the products are security related. This all sounds great but it doesn't really align with my interests.

I initially joined because I wanted to have some experience and I didn't receive any calls from FAANG companies last summer(tried 2-3 positions in Google, 1 Amazon and went on an Optiver interview). The other bonus is that my current team sold the projects as cryptography related, which although not false is hardly the main thing. They ended up liking me though, so I joined as a Junior for my first ever job and was promoted to Mid 5 months later

I'd like to be in a more competitive/challenging scene. This for me means either FAANG or some challenging niches in CS I've found interesting like Quantitative development (and analysis),HFT, 3D graphics

Problem is that there aren't many Quant companies where I live and I don't think my resume is impressive in any way to potential recruiters from there. 

This is where the Research assistant position comes in. I did a few electives after my intro Stats course and my professor liked me a lot, so he invited me to join.

1n6tx4q,A Complicated Counter Offer,"I’m a senior software engineer at my current company. It’s a well known toy company in the US that most people would dream of working for. The overall company culture is brilliant but my particular team is quite toxic - a reactive manager, manipulative behaviour amongst colleagues, gossiping, weird secretive meetings, no transparency etc. I try my best to stay out of the drama but it gets me down some days. I’m friends with two people in this team and they’re both going to leave within the next 3 months.

I’ve been applying too and I received an offer for a senior software engineer role at a well known financial services company. It’s based in my hometown, where there’s a much lower cost of living but remote if I want, for $95k. My current salary is $98k. I live in a super expensive city and RTO means I need to be in the office 3 days a week.

I did the calculations and I’d be better off leaving plus my wife and I are considering having a baby so it would be great to be back around family.

I’m friends with two people in this team and they’re both going to leave within the next 3 months.

I’ve been applying too and I received an offer for a senior software engineer role at a well known financial services company. It’s based in my hometown, where there’s a much lower cost of living but remote if I want, for $95k. My current salary is $98k. I live in a super expensive city and RTO means I need to be in the office 3 days a week.

1n7b8ag,Advice for starting first SWE job,"Hi all, next week I will be starting my first job out of college (undergrad/master's at T5). I will be working at a Series B startup at a US tech hub. I am wondering what are the things I should optimize for in this experience and how I can get the most out of my experience here. 

  
Some of my professional goals in the future:

* Working at a top AI lab/startup in hypergrowth- either as a SWE or research engineer
* Starting my own startup
* Becoming a VC

Initially, I joined this startup as opposed to a more established tech/finance company because I wanted to gain more confidence across many different areas of the stack, which is something the big tech company would not have given me. 

Some specific questions I have (but please do chip in with your 2 cents even if not directly related):

* How can I most effectively use my time during work?
* How can I most effectively use my time after work? (start working on projects that can turn into their own startups? Attend networking events? How do I maintain network connections beyond the initial first impression?)
* What are some signs I should look out for that I am ready for the next chapter?

1n70skq,Go into Applied Intuition (SWE) or a semiconductor company as a researcher?,"I recently got a new grad offer at Applied Intuition, but the reviews on teamblind / glassdoor have me unsettled. I can keep my head down and do my work and don't mind working 50-60 hrs/week, but I'm worried that I don't have what it takes to survive in that fast of a place.

At the same time, being PIP'd in less than a year will also hurt my career.

Why am I so certain I won't make it?

I've recently graduated from college with a BSc in Computer Science. For the past year (exactly 1 year next month) I've been working as Frontend Developer in a super small local company. It's been pretty good and I feel like I've learned a lot. Here's the company setup: my superior/boss is also the only backend developer here (I'm the only Frontend dev) so we work closely together. However, my workload is often determined by the superior's work done (since I can't really do much outside of bug-fixing and optimizations if there's no new features) and for this entire summer it's been close to none.

This is nice in a sense that I can focus on my personal projects (which I am), but in the back of my mind I'm still worried that I'm stagnating commercially, and I think that especially in these early years of my professional experience I would greatly benefit from mentorship and I could learn a lot from other developers as well. Eventually I would like to climb the ranks etc which is simply not possible here where I currently am...

What do you guys think? Start looking to join a big team/company to learn (working in teams, scrum, code-reviews etc) or stay here?

3. They raised it to $1100/month for 20 hours/week during probation, and then $1400/month for 40 hours/week after probation.

This makes no sense. $1100 for 20 hours/week is reasonable, but $1400 for 40 hours/week is extremely low. It feels like they either only want part-time work but don’t admit it, or they are simply underpaying.

I don’t really want to accept, because it feels deceptive. Financially I am fine, but my resume gap keeps growing.

I've been working ten years in my field and feel that I've kinda capped out in a professional sense of where I can reasonably expect to get to given my skill set, now working in a creative-related role in a company where moving departments to a different internal role might be possible. 

I have basic skills in CS at this point... tweaking HTML / CSS on personal websites, requesting and formatting data using Python, workable understanding of OOP ideas, etc. 

I've had my head buried in what the career path looks like for creative professionals for the last ten years, but over the last couple months I've been considering a switch to CS, especially software engineering. 

I've been networking at my current company which has a decent number of engineering positions, trying to do as much LinkedIn Learning and freeCodeCamp as I can in my free time, and trying to come up with as many little personal projects as I can to build up a portfolio of projects, and documenting anything I touch at work that could possibly relate to CS work in the future. 

I would love to be able to start applying for junior level software engineering roles in 1-2 years, and I know there's really no magic bullets, but is there anything I'm overlooking as far as areas I should be focusing on when building experience and knowledge?

1n6pvk5,Should I get an internship or skip to new grad opportunities?,"Hey all!

I'm a senior in computer science and am projected to graduate with my BS by may of next year. The unfortunate thing is that I've had no luck with internships in years prior. I just hadn't really tried before, and really didn't have anything passionate about in CS.

However, right before the last summer break, I found a new found love for web dev, and have been putting in an average of 4-5 hours everyday, and I can confidently call myself a full stack dev.

As the title says, I want to know what you all think about my predicament because I might have gained a lot of personal experience, but I've seen a lot of people saying that real experience (i.e. internships, etc.) is much more valuable to recruiters, especially in this job market.

So, I've narrowed down my future path to the following:

1. Apply and have a better shot at internship opportunities this time around, then either hope for return offer, or apply to full time jobs after internship.

2. Go right into jobs that are looking for new grads.

3. Get into a recruitment agency like Motion and look for contracting work from there (I talked to a software dev with 20yoe and he said that this was a underrated pipeline).

Also, I do want to get into entrepreneurship, but i don't foresee myself doing that until I have solid technical experience.

1n5u2iw,Are there any drawbacks in being considered a Lead Software Engineer vs a Senior,"In my current role I am currently a Senior Software Engineer, however my role has had me manage other members of a development team, oversee everyone's work, and plan out work and tickets for sprints. Technically, the role that I do might actually be closer to a Lead Software Engineer than it is a Senior position because instead of having deep technical work I am more on a managerial side for the other engineers.

I am wondering if I should negotiate my role to change to Lead Software Engineer from Senior, however, I wanted to know if there are any drawbacks. Although I don't mind the managerial side because I think it has been very valuable experience thus far, I still want to work on deep technical work in future roles and I don't want to be blocked for technical roles because I'm in a more managerial role right now.

Would you say given all these benefits it's still worth it to career transition and pursue this profession today in 2025? Any advice or even alternative careers to consider if not software engineering or development?",101,1453,1555,0.041,0.713,0.246,0.9967,Positive,False,False,False

1n5p5s8,Is this a good senior design project that will have a good impact for me in the career world?,"Hi all! I am a computer science student in my 4th year of bachelors degree and we have a senior design project that I am working on at the minute.  I really have two main interests in CS: computer graphics and systems development (embedded, OS, compiler stuff).  I am already working on an embedded systems project for research making a drone that uses computer vision, but because of coordination issues, I cannot use that as my senior design.

However, for my senior design project for CS (we have 7 weeks effectively) I had the idea to make a real time pathtracing engine that allows users to switch between multi threading CPU and GPU parallelization to accommodate for those who have less powerful GPUs or those who do have powerful GPUs and want to squeeze every bit of performance out.  As for the GPU mode, this will be rendered using OpenGL compute shaders to create an image and display said image as a texture on a quad mapped to the whole screen.  My goal is to have a simple, open source, and lightweight real time dynamic pathtracer for use in things like architectural/interior design showcases, hobbyist animators/3D artists, and for game development.  This project is also supposed to be more research oriented into the methods of effective raytracing/pathtracing in real time.

Though, I do have to wonder, does this seem like it’s been overdone in the past? I’ve never seen it myself but there are many raytracers out there, I just don’t know if it will matter.  If it does, is there anything new I can bring to the table with it? And does the research aspect/helping people in your community aspect which goes along with this project work well?

It was a really stressful period during work. Up to that point I felt I was good. After that I felt I had a lot of flaws and was not good. Now I am in a better team working full time as I finished university this year.

And right now I have heightened imposter syndrome. I ask my tech lead every week if my performance is good, do I ask stupid questions, if I do not waste his time with these questions. He always answers all is fine and no time is wasted (He is also great tech lead, I have insane respect for him and my team).

So I feel bad I keep asking the same question but I also not sure what to do. The stress really stirms me up...

I am also panicking on my performance... I feel I do 50-70% of what my colleagues with similar experience do. I try to improve my focus, ask my roommates to not interrupt but I still I can not get into a flow state. I will have 2-5h of this semi-focused time to get some work done.

These questions happened in a span of a 7 days... And might not look anything that bad... but it really messed with my mental... I am not sure how I can escape this imposter syndrome and get better...

Thank you everyone for your feedback. Many responses were very detailed and thoughtful. Your insight can help.

3. Build am ATS friendly resume. Keywords are important.
4. Take contract work to build experience
5. Follow up an inteview with additional information that supports that you are a good fit.
6. The university internship program is the main way new devs get hired because the  organization used that to assess you.
7. Referrals are important. Some orgs review all referrals
8. Networking is an important way to get in front of the line. Meetups can make connections. Contribute to open source for recognition purposes.
9. Take an un-related job in an org and lobby for yourself into the job you want.
10. Expect to provide references to back up stated experience
11. Business environment uncertainty means that orgs are not hiring jr positions because risk is lower with sr devs. Nice way of saying, jr positions are very scarce.

13. Its a numbers game. Most candidates are similar. So just apply a lot and wish for luck!

1n653wu,Why is the media obsessed with CS doom?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been noticing something disturbing lately. If you search for “Computer Science” in Google News, almost all headlines are about CS grads struggling to find jobs, rescinded offers, or having to take non-tech jobs (like this is something uncommon or bad). Meanwhile, if you search other fields like physics, chemistry, or biology, which have far fewer direct job opportunities, you mostly see articles about breakthroughs, discoveries, and innovations. AS IT SHOULD BE!  
  
Look at some examples I found when searching for ""Computer Science"":

* “150 job applications, rescinded offers: Computer science grads are struggling to find work” (CNN)
* “Goodbye, $165,000 Tech Jobs. Student Coders Seek Work at Chipotle.” (NYT)
* “US computer science graduates return to school as jobs lost to AI” (The Korea Times)

  
It’s a constant stream of doom and gloom. And I’m starting to worry about the effect this has on new generations. In my country, the number of students applying for CS programs has dropped by half this year. The trend will continue. That’s a massive change, and it seems like the media is actively discouraging people from entering one of the fastest-growing, highest-paying fields.

The market is bad, alright. I get that. However, it's for everyone. Any major. So why is CS the only field where the media pushes this narrative? It almost feels like paid propaganda or at the very least, sensationalism at the expense of future students’ motivation.

I know tech jobs are competitive but the media framing is extreme, one-sided, and frankly, misleading. Most CS graduates still find good jobs, and the field remains full of opportunities. You can work in any industry. There are endless computational problems still to be tackled. I literally mean endless. Regardless, CS teaches you amazing problem-solving skills, allowing you to transition to many other jobs outside of tech.

1n54ess,Next step after big tech internship,"**Hi everyone,**

I just wrapped up my first internship at a FAANG company this summer, and they expressed interest in having me back for another internship next summer (my last one before I graduate).

For context, I’m heading into my 4th year of CS at a target school in Canada. I’m trying to figure out what makes the most sense for my career long-term:

* Should I return to the same FAANG for another internship?
* Or should I branch out (another FAANG, startup, something in SF) to diversify my experience?

My main concern is that if I don’t go back, I lose the direct hiring pipeline into this FAANG. If I do a return internship then securing a new grad role is going to be very easy. On the other hand, the role is in Toronto—so the pay is lower than US offices, and the local tech scene doesn’t compare to SF. Since I’m still early in my career, I want to maximize learning and growth.

I’d love to hear from people who’ve been in a similar position: what did you choose, how did it impact your job search after graduation, and what would you recommend I do with this opportunity?

1n5chau,"career questions, pls help a cooked student","I’m a 2nd year undergrad student and i go to a community college and really just don’t know anything regarding career stuff, like everyone around me has been getting internships since high school and doing programs i’ve never even heard of. So anyways, I’m trying to apply for stuff this year even though I feel so behind but I have a couple of questions.

Firstly, what kind of projects are resume worthy? I’ve made a book log project with c++ (functions to add, sort, delete, and edit books and with files) and a derivative calculator in python (made my own functions and with a gui) on my own, not from tutorials or anything. I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people’s resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that’s a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that’s something worth sharing or if maybe I’m just not ready yet to be applying to internships.

Alright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I’ve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they’re not very relevant to cs so I don’t wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it’s worth adding? Lmk guys.

Thirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me. Please help 🙁.

Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic ""good project"" is that I could make. It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better. But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.

The projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't ""impressive"" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are ""expected"" to have they just don't measure up at all. Make a meal planner web app with a group for a class project? Well probably someone out there made something better solo and made actual money with that. Make a networked board game with a different group for another class? Well someone out there probably did that exact game idea but better and also made a profit. Make a substantial mod for an old video game that required me to use assembly and reverse engineer game code? Well there are other mods out there that look far more impressive technically even in the time period I made it. (And that reverse engineering sounds like small potatoes to any actual software developer probably even if it took me a long time to figure out? Oh you figured out how to print more digits in the health bar and hunted down every piece of assembly that touched the health value to make it use a bigger data type to increase the maximum? Well in any ""real"" game that process would've been a single line change so they would just think I'm stupid for making it take so long. I told one hiring person about solving a certain bug where I actually used a youtube video of someone playing the mod to help me figure out how to reproduce it but to any real developer it feels very unimpressive, because if I coded it ""right"" in the first place there would be no bug to fix, or if I was more meticulous about every little piece of code I put in I would just know how to catch the bug in the first place)

I just don't know how to make anything good, like I could make some random thing and solve weird and difficult problems and use every technology under the sun but no hiring people would look at it because if it doesn't make money or have a ton of users or looks exactly like the thing they're already making then it's just a dumb toy project to them and I shouldn't even have it on my resume or GitHub in the first place. I don't know how to come up with those ideas that attract money and users or how to fill all my competency holes without spending a ton of money (how to make the perfect graphic design and art that attracts people or how to market a thing to get all those users to use the thing).

1n463z4,This field is 80% politics.,"Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.

This is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.

When it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.

There's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.

I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.

So many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work.

I have really good connections, one is a full-time at AWS, the other is Interning at Palantir. I revamped my resume like 9 times, and the final version they said it looks very good.

I have recently applied to like 100 jobs (these are for winter and summer internships 2026). I am getting rejected mostly or the Automatic OAs.

Recently one of the unpaid internships I applied to told me they like my experience and they would like to have me onboard. It was for Fall sem, so and I don't have any internship lined up on Fall sem so I said yes why not.

This is going to be my 2nd unpaid internship, and the worst part of it is, the interviewer told me 300 people applied and they went through some of them manually and they liked my ""real life"" experience. This means I got the job based on mostly luck.

I mean 300 people for a fucking unpaid internship. I was lowkey in disbelief.

The worst part of it is, a course I am going to take in Winter is gonna pair me up with another company and I will be having my 3rd Unpaid internship there.

I just want someone upper year telling me everything is gonna be fine, I am so sick of fucking working for free, and you may say ""Well then don't apply for any"", and yes you are right, but I genuinly feel like I am staying behind when I am not working at X company and gaining at least some experience.

I see people on here and other places Deciding whether to Choose google with 200k TC or Meta with 220K TC but a higher cost of living area. Like when am I gonna have such an option?

The point I am trying to make is, I am going to one of the best unis in my country (UofT) and I have chosen one of the hottest programs rn (CS), and I still can't find a job and have to rely on unpaid internships.

I feel very beat, I have lost the drive to work hard, cuz it feels like even if I will graduate and accomplish something I still feel like I won't get hired. I know jobs take a while to respond back, I applied to 100 and all rejections have been instant and most ""Yes's"" come down the line but still man.

I just need someone in comments to tell me everything is going to be OK and that the industry and the economy will get better (I am in Canada). (I just wish I was born 12 years earlier and graduated in 2016).

Thx for reading.

**TL:DR: I'm a solo bioinformatics engineer in research, feeling stuck as AI-generated code becomes more common and peer learning fades. I value deep technical skills and was planning to learn Rust, but now I’m unsure if that still matters. Do yo feel the same?** ^(AI-generated TLDR)

I'm a 29F bioinformatics software engineer working in cancer research. My background is originally in chemistry/biology, but I’ve always loved software and computers, just didn’t think of it as a career until I discovered bioinformatics. Since then, I’ve done a master’s in the field and have spent the last few years specializing in Python, working in a research lab where I develop tools for genomic data analysis.

Over the past year, I've been feeling a bit stuck and wandering around the huge amount of knowledge that software engineering can provide, and I felt like I needed more of mentoring (there is no senior in this field in my lab) and to develop a career path for technical growth and in general to understand my career direction.

Regarding mentorship, I'm the only one pushing and researching for proper software engineering standards, modern tools, testing, CI/CD, versioning, code quality, etc. And while I like that role, it’s also isolating and sometimes I don't know If I a making the right choices. I feel alone. I don’t have people around me to pair program with or learn from via code review. I talked to my PI about finding a more technical mentor which she was super supportive about.

Regarding the direction of my career, I have also presented a career plan to her, but lately I feel that it's getting outdated by the seconds, given this *AI hype* has been on lately. I feel very alone and lost. I feel that the thing I value the most: critical thinking, competence, deep-understanding, quality and reliability, designing before implementation has been squished into a general ""*give the right prompt to the Agent and let them do the job*"".

Lately I've been realizing that most of the PRs I am reviewing are AI-generated and most of the time, the second iteration, doesn't even address all the comments I made (which are bio-related and therefore crucial). I feel bummed and not sure how to tackle this in a ""nice"" way. This has become draining, and I am losing motivation.

Above all, career planning feels super confusing now. For example, I had planned to invest time in learning Rust to get a better grasp of systems-level programming and go beyond Python’s limitations. But now I am asking myself it that is even worth it anymore.

I don’t want to sound bitter, and I’m not anti-AI. I do use it in fact and do not think it will replace my job as an experienced Bioinformatics engineer. But I also love the building things thoughtfully and learning from peers, something that feels harder in my lab. So I was wondering if it was me or the environment and I should move to another industry or it's a common sentiment.

1n4zk0h,software/math careers,"I love math, my decision to take CS was heavily influenced by maths. I like math so much that my password is a property of my favourite math function. I like programming too. But, I miss doing math. I tried to take as many math electives as possible during university. I’ve taken number theory, numerical analysis, Linear Algebra 2 and 3 on top of my required math courses.



Discrete math, design and analysis of algorithms, were my favourite computer science course. I like to prove things. I used to write more than one proof for a problem where others used to struggle to write just one solution. I’ve had a GA comment on how much he liked grading my assignments. My obsession with proofs started as a kid when I first learned the “test of divisibility by 9”. I didn’t believe how the sum of the digits of a number effected it divisibility by 9. There was no proof in the book and my teacher didn’t quite really convince me (remember I was in grade 3 or grade 4). Every time I see a number(phone numbers, registration numbers, address..) I used to mentally add it’s digits and then mentally divide the number by 9 to try to disprove the divisibility test (It was in my grade 8 when I switched school, I finally learned about the proof for divisibility). I still sometimes add the digits (it has become a sub conscious habit now).

I like math so much that my password is a property of my favourite math function. I like programming too. But, I miss doing math. I tried to take as many math electives as possible during university. I’ve taken number theory, numerical analysis, Linear Algebra 2 and 3 on top of my required math courses.



Discrete math, design and analysis of algorithms, were my favourite computer science course. I like to prove things. I used to write more than one proof for a problem where others used to struggle to write just one solution. I’ve had a GA comment on how much he liked grading my assignments. My obsession with proofs started as a kid when I first learned the “test of divisibility by 9”. I didn’t believe how the sum of the digits of a number effected it divisibility by 9. There was no proof in the book and my teacher didn’t quite really convince me (remember I was in grade 3 or grade 4). Every time I see a number(phone numbers, registration numbers, address..) I used to mentally add it’s digits and then mentally divide the number by 9 to try to disprove the divisibility test (It was in my grade 8 when I switched school, I finally learned about the proof for divisibility). I still sometimes add the digits (it has become a sub conscious habit now).

3. Swapping priorities of tasks multiple times in the same week.

4. Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.

5. Meetings that feel more like an interrogation than a useful share of information.

6. Makes decisions very fast without much information at all. This includes creating new meetings, cancelling meetings, creating new outings, letting people off early then asking them to stay for an adhoc meeting, etc.

7. Reassigns work between different team members, also without much information or thought.

8. Seems to be completely oblivious to how these constant disruptions are impacting members of the team (I and other have brought these up personally, and he denied it).

How many of you actually genuinely like ML as a technology and are willing to use products that leverage ML technologies?,"I was reading through the Bishop book today. Pattern recognition and machine learning. It is theory heavy. It starts off with something like ""Let's fit a polynomial curve to these training points"". And then about 10 pages down, he is like lets assume at each point on the fitted curve comes from a normal distribution, with the mean equal to the value we predicted. And standard deviation equal to some value we assume. I was like that's an interesting thought but why would you do that?

Then the author frames this as a maximum likelihood problem. Wrestles with the equations a bit and proves that the sum of squares error function arises out of maximum likelihood if you assume a Gaussian noise distribution.

I am completely blown away by this! That's so interesting. I had fun reading all of this theory. But then I put my book aside. I sat down in my chair and asked myself ""what do I do with this knowledge?"" ""Why am I learning this?""

""If I understand the material in the Bishop book better, I can get better at building machine learning models""

Recommendations in Amazon that I never even look at. Ads on Facebook that I always skip.

Is it just me or is it the case that people just see ML based products as just a Gimmick? All the AI features that Samsung and Apple ship like erase something in the background. Summarize the text message. Generate a reply for a text. Does anyone ever use them everday?

1n4c95r,What's the worst case scenario for a failed cs major?,"Best case scenario, as everyone knows, is getting a zillion hundred thousand dollar full-time offer at FAANG after doing 6 internships, acing 10 rounds of interviews, and doing a million leetcode hards and system design practice. Living in San Francisco or Manhattan or somewhere, and then buying some big mansion in New Jersey or somewhere idfk. Then you marry a beautiful woman and have 2.5 kids and a golden retriever or something.

But the worst case scenario, which is what I unfortunately seem to be experiencing right now as a middle-class zoomer about to commence his senior year (and with 18 credits as a commuter student no less thanks to parental idiocy which is another story), is that you basically apply to 800 internships over 2 years, get like 5 interviews, and then you receive 0 offers at all. (Or if you're needy, some unpaid internship that's worth nothing.) So you're left with a literal bloodbath for a full-time job market that you're basically forced to dive into headfirst without any weapons or armor. You're basically going to have to prove you're better than over 1000 other people to a bunch of HR people and managers. It's a fucking humiliation show.

Here's how I think my life is going to play out, barring any miracles:

- I apply to like over 1000 full time jobs between last July and around 6 months after I graduate, both SWE and SWE adjacent. I'll get less than 10 responses that are anything better than an autorejection, but none will result in an offer.

- I try to upskill, with projects and open source etc., but nothing I do improves my chances, as there will always be some other person (including MANY laid off workers) better than me.

- I might be forced to work a fucking McJob with 0 transferable skills anytime between today and 6 months after I graduate.

- I network a bunch but it doesn't help.

- I'm 21 now, and I end up living in my conservative mom's bedroom, shuttling to and from Burger King, Walmart, or maybe Best Buy if I'm fortunate. I probably won't be unemployed, but what I do definitely won't be enough to allow me to live on my own anywhere not excessively remote or violent.

- I keep getting told by a bunch of people on the internet to join the military, and I keep having to explain to them that autistic people aren't allowed to enlist.

- My degree eventually expires due to me not using it. Maybe if I still care, I do some IT certs to get a basic IT help desk job that pays $15 per hour, that I probably could've gotten without (my parents) wasting money on college at all.

- I look up my Chinese friends on Instagram to see how they're doing. Some are high-earners. Some are engaged, or even married. But almost all are making more than me, and almost none are living at home with mom and flipping burgers.

- I struggle with whether to support my parents and how much because of how conservative and intolerant they've been (worst case of this was literally slapping me). Maybe I piss them off so much they slowly cut me off, who knows.

- And then, my parents retire or die. Which sadly happens to everyone someday.

- My suburban house is foreclosed or something.

- I'm forced to live on the street and collect food stamps.

- I do a bunch of political things, like voting or protesting, but none of that magically improves my situation.

- I die in my 50s due to some ailment that was worse than it could've been due to our country's screwed up Healthcare system.

I know I'm being a bit of a doomer so please talk some sense into me.

Right now, I’m fully working in Python + ML at my company a startup but joined there as an intern for backend(Nodejs) with beginner level Python. The issue is, I’m doing everything on my own as my manager asked to do a ML based prediction system which grabbed his attention but I completely vibe coded which I informed him, but he asked me to develop that,the problem is no senior guidance, just learning from the internet of course using AI agents while under constant pressure from my manager to deliver and doesn't feel like getting proper experience , guidance and learning, the pay is very low which discourages me a lot.  On top of that, IT/ML feels very saturated, competitive, and insecure.

Recently I watched a podcast with Zoho’s Rajendran Dhandapani  where he openly said Zoho reduced hiring because of AI. Since Zoho is a genuine Indian MNC, that really hit me — it made me question all the optimistic takes like “AI won’t take jobs, it’ll just reduce workload.” If real companies are already cutting hiring, then the risk is real.

That’s why I’ve also started preparing for bank exams (IBPS, SBI, etc.) as a backup. Banking prep is tough (especially reasoning/maths speed, which I’m weak at), but the **stability, work-life balance, and job security** are appealing. Plus, being under the **reservation category** gives me certain advantages (extra attempts and benefits), which makes banking a realistic option.

Right now, my plan is to **balance both IT/ML and bank exam prep** — keep working and learning in IT, while seriously preparing for exams, until I crack one. But I’m worried I might end up being average at both.

So my question:

* Is balancing both a good strategy, or should I go all-in on one?
* For someone in my position, which path seems smarter long-term?

1n2h4bi,Spending too much time here is not healthy for your mental health,"On the internet it's usually the extreme outlier cases, either people who got extremely lucky or extremely unlucky, the average joe is not represented much.  


That's why you see here people complaining how ~~fucked~~ bad the job market these day and it's nearly impossible to find a job while reading about that one fresh grad that found a job at meta as the ceo's boss.

And as a result, people start comparing themselves to those outliers which feeds into the perfectionist mindset that ""If I don't make it at FAANG i'm gonna be homeless""... And that makes the whole thing sooo **stressful** for everyone, especially for student/fresh grads.



It's like we all forgot that you have a good career is by learning programing, not stressing about the job market, latest career tips, and comparing ourselves to others.

that's why a lot are freaking out on this subreddit about the job market. Is it bad rn? maybe, idk I'm too young to know how was it back then. 

scrolling on reddit at this point is mostly just... desperation porn.

For me as a student, I've decided to focus only on my data science studies and stop worrying about the ""latest career tips"" and ""The Perfect Roadmap"" and just do the thing that I'm supposed to do, study. I don't have to make a plan for my career or know how it's gonna be for me, I'm just gonna do the best chess move for me rn which is learning.

That's why you see here people complaining how ~~fucked~~ bad the job market these day and it's nearly impossible to find a job while reading about that one fresh grad that found a job at meta as the ceo's boss.

And as a result, people start comparing themselves to those outliers which feeds into the perfectionist mindset that ""If I don't make it at FAANG i'm gonna be homeless""... And that makes the whole thing sooo **stressful** for everyone, especially for student/fresh grads.



It's like we all forgot that you have a good career is by learning programing, not stressing about the job market, latest career tips, and comparing ourselves to others.

that's why a lot are freaking out on this subreddit about the job market. Is it bad rn? maybe, idk I'm too young to know how was it back then. 

scrolling on reddit at this point is mostly just... desperation porn.

For me as a student, I've decided to focus only on my data science studies and stop worrying about the ""latest career tips"" and ""The Perfect Roadmap"" and just do the thing that I'm supposed to do, study. I don't have to make a plan for my career or know how it's gonna be for me, I'm just gonna do the best chess move for me rn which is learning.

1n2ap76,Why are so many Software Engineers burnt out?,"Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.

I can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I’d also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I’d ever stand out in any way.

What surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.

That shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.

I know it’s tough because “just do more tickets” feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.

Curious if anyone else has felt the same?

I have about 3 years out of college working in the public sector as a senior full stack developer (I thought they were crazy hiring me too, but I've done well in this role).

Not including benefits I take home about 80k/year right now with 8% salary increase per year (5%+3% GSI) until I cap out, where I will then get just the 3%/year GSI.

1n3gpua,Should I switch from Software Dev ( Mern Stack ) to devops ?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working as a **web developer ( MERN stack )** for about 3 years now, and lately I’ve been thinking about transitioning into **DevOps**

A couple of reasons why -

---

## Why I’m considering DevOps

* The **web dev job market** feels really tough right now.

* **AI is rapidly automating** a lot of frontend/backend tasks.

* DevOps seems to have **longer term scope** and feels less prone to being replaced by AI (at least compared to web dev).

* Having both skill sets (**Web Dev + DevOps**) might give me an **edge in job applications**.

---

## My questions to people in DevOps / who’ve made the switch -

* Do you think it’s actually **worth moving from web dev to DevOps**?
* How steep is the **learning curve**? What’s the best path to get started?
* Does DevOps really have **better job stability and scope** compared to web development?
* Or should I just **focus on web dev + DSA** instead?

Needles to say, the issues he presented are not frequent, they happened a few times but that's it so he picked those as examples.

Why I am asking if this is stack ranking is because:

1- The manager said he beleives i am between underacheived and acheived, he said i am in the upper echelon of under acheived and that I will not be PIPed, he said this coming fiscal year he will focus on me more to help me out

2- he gave me a bonus and a raise slighlty less than what the acheived person gets.

3- the company lost some 20 million dollars due to some fuck ups in the finance department, so everyone got a 20% cut from their bonuses

1n2ccq1,I'm so SICK of automatic OA invitations followed by immediate rejections.,"Why can't these recruiters spend maybe just 30 seconds reviewing resumes first before sending the OA email? Instead of wasting applicants' hours preparing and grinding through their OA tasks, only to reject us within a day of submission? Is this some kind of compliance test?

I'm tempted to create an open-source list of trash companies that don't respect applicants' time. Likewise, I don't care how prestigious you are - you're a TRASH company to me if you show no respect for applicants' time.

I might not have explained myself clearly and caused some confusion based on the comments I received. Think about two different recruiting workflows:

1. AI screening -> manual screening -> applicant completes the OA -> interview process...
2. Applicant completes the OA -> AI screening -> manual screening -> interview process...

The second approach doesn't make any sense, unless the screening algorithm gives the OA result high weight/priority (even so you can still apply AI screening without OA before the OA). It's a huge waste of applicants' time as they could have been rejected in the first place instead of wasting huge amount of time and energy grinding down the OA tasks.

1n20hx8,US federal court backs California’s fight against caste discrimination at Cisco in a landmark ruling,"In a landmark ruling on July 18, 2025, a US federal court upheld California’s authority to act against caste discrimination, rejecting the *Hindu American Foundation’s* claims that caste protections violate the religious rights of Hindu Americans.


The case originated from CRD’s 2020 lawsuit against Cisco for allegedly enabling caste-based discrimination against a Dalit engineer by higher-caste Indian-American managers. HAF had earlier tried to intervene in the Cisco case but was denied by California state courts

Four key outcomes

The court’s 31-page judgement outlined four major outcomes:

> Affirmation of state authority: The CRD has the constitutional right to enforce anti-discrimination laws, including against caste-based discrimination.

> Legitimacy of CRD actions: The lawsuit against Cisco Systems, a major California tech firm, was found to be a legitimate public enforcement action, not a private legal dispute.

> Rejection of religious freedom argument: The court ruled that the CRD’s enforcement did not violate any First Amendment rights of Hindu Americans, dismissing the argument as “entirely unpersuasive.”

> No standing for HAF: The court held that HAF does not represent all Hindu Americans and failed to show concrete links to the broader community. “Plaintiffs have shown no facts demonstrating actual activities, engagement, or funding mechanisms,” the judge wrote.

1n2ksj8,"As a Spring Boot / Java developer, should I learn GenAI or double down on backend/DevOps skills?","I’m a Spring Boot / Java backend developer, and I’m at a bit of a career crossroads.

Right now, I see two clear paths for upskilling:

1. Learn GenAI / LLM-related development (prompt engineering, integrating LLMs into applications, fine-tuning, vector databases, RAG, etc.)
2. Double down on my existing backend/dev skills – improve depth in Java/Spring Boot, testing, microservices, system design, cloud-native concepts, Kubernetes, DevOps pipelines, observability, and scaling distributed systems.

Here’s my situation:

* I’m not really interested in GenAI at the moment. It feels like a hype-driven bubble, and I don’t want to learn a stack just because it’s trendy.
* My main focus has been building solid, scalable backend systems, and I enjoy working in that space.
* I don’t mind picking up GenAI *if it becomes unavoidable in backend roles*, but I don’t want to spread myself too thin.

  
To be clear:

* I am not the type of person who chases the latest tech hype unless it directly benefits my day-to-day work.
* Even though I am interested in GenAI personally, right now what I want to focus more on is being employable and relevant in the upcoming years as a Java backend developer.
* I am also focusing on a specific side-hustle which I want to turn around into a full time business in the future, so I don't have the time to pursue/learn something new from the scratch unless it is absolutely necessary.

My questions are:

* Will I be missing out on backend job opportunities now (or in the next few years) if I don’t learn GenAI?
* Is GenAI integration actually becoming a *must-have* skill for Java/Spring Boot developers, or is it still more of a niche?
* From a long-term career perspective (5+ years), would I be better off becoming a stronger backend engineer with deep cloud/microservices/devops skills, or should I invest in GenAI sooner rather than later?
* For those of you working in the industry — are companies actually *expecting* backend developers to know GenAI, or is it more of a nice-to-have skill for specific roles/domains?

None of the internships I got were for anything very software development related (no I can't go back to them for a full time job either) and I'm not even remotely qualified for any PLC related roles (they always want people with actual engineering degrees, and/or several years of experience). I don't have a bunch of metrics to throw around and I can't make up metrics without them being wildly unbelievable or wildly unimpressive and then getting my resume thrown out because of that. I just don't have hard numbers for anything. I don't think I am supposed to commit corporate espionage to see the exact dollar value of every single project I made as an intern, I don't even have hard numbers for how much better things are because it was just making projects out of nothing so I don't really have much context to anything about whatever was there before. I tried to get internships in college but that situation is basically the exact same as the present (very few positions out there, basically no response, extremely high standards).

I just don't see a point in making more projects to put on my resume considering that I don't think hiring people ever care about projects unless it's something making actual money (and that kind of thing is beyond my ability to do, I am not a very creative person who can come up with good ideas that make millions and I'm definitely not a professional entrepreneur, marketer, graphic designer, etc. Even if I was then I wouldn't even need an entry level position in the first place?). The only thing it would really help me with is being able to throw more random technologies on my resume but that isn't something that actually counts as real experience? (even if I build a project using XYZ technology it doesn't ""count"" because it's not real ""work"" experience with XYZ thing). The projects that are already there are already pretty extensive and took a long time to make, so the effort required to make a project better than them is absurdly high, but even then in the grand scheme of things they are not impressive compared to everything out there (In fact I think that maybe a lot of companies have a negative opinion of game dev projects so it might even be better if I got rid of them?). Make a meal planner web app as a group project? Well someone out there probably did something like that on their own in a shorter time and made actual money with it. Make a game mod with a lot of assembly and get some number of players? Well far more impressive things have been made already even with the exact same game. For every ""hard problem"" I explain to the hiring people they probably have already heard a different candidate talk about something much harder.

It just feels frustrating like everything I've done is completely pointless because I'm not literally perfect, like why go to college or make projects if it's never enough for these companies. I'm not even qualified for random lower level help desk / IT type things either (pretty much everything there still wants experience outside of the bottom of the barrel positions that pay worse than retail and aren't even CS related anymore). It feels like my qualifications are just going to get worse over time, places are just going to throw my resume out for not getting a ""real"" position out of college (even if I take those random positions since those are not really CS oriented at all). I don't really see the job market improving in a short enough time frame for me to get anything good before my qualifications drop to zero (in fact I'm pretty sure it will get worse in the future). I'm already seeing 2026 grad positions and all the 2025 grad positions have dried up completely, so it might be too late for me at this point. What do I even do at this point?

1n2890a,Is it normal for managers/CEOs to always rush deployments?,"I’ve been working with a client for the past 7 years. The pay is decent and there used to be a fair amount of flexibility, but there’s always this constant rush to deploy things.

Two years ago, two new devs joined the team. The client is the CEO of the company, not very technical, but he often pushes “shortcuts” to speed up development. Usually they’re hacky and add technical debt. Because he messages devs individually instead of going through a single point of contact which should be one of the devs that can convert his request into a technical solution, the result is a messy codebase where people step on each other’s toes. One of the newer devs is inexperienced and sometimes pushes changes that break other people’s work. I do code reviews on his work whenever we have time, but those are happening in a rush because I always have something that I need to deploy myself asap.

On top of that, there’s never enough time to write clean code. Almost everything is for a demo or “needs to be deployed ASAP.” We start working on big changes on reporting a week before the end of the month, with the target of having it ready at the beginning of the next month. We end up doing daily production deployments on a fairly large app. This app is used by big company clients' employees, the entire marketing team which is the main activity of the company, and even manages customer relationships, so it’s not a toy project.

My concern is that after 7 years, I don’t feel like I’ve gained much real experience because of the constant rush and hacky workarounds. For context, I’m a full stack developer with 14 years' experience.

Both companies do similar things, and the executives were mostly talking about how great the marketing department was.

They also have a large waitlist of clients wanting to use their product, they just need to flesh out the software to support them and remove some manual tasks.

I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.

Maybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.

1n2i7kw,A couple interesting data points regarding LI jobs,"First, an encouraging (albeit extreme) example of why it's good to apply jobs even if they have lots of applications already. I applied to a job on May 29 and had assumed it had disappeared into the void like so many others do. Then yesterday I got a response (yes, nearly 3 months later) inviting me to a 30 minute interview with them. I suspect they posted the job to have a reserve list in case someone left the company, but it's also possible they waded through a bunch of candidate interviews and just couldn't find anyone that was good enough or that was honest on their application.

Second, I saw a job posting today that is only open to candidates in Latin America, but 100+ people have already clicked apply. So it begs the question if ""people"" clicked apply or if bots did. At any rate, it's worth ignoring that applied metric and the company may get to your resumé eventually and be relieved to find that you're actually qualified (and in this case, actually live in Latin America somewhere!).

• Makes up coding rules on the spot, won't document them, then gets mad when we don't follow his ""standards"" that only exist in random Slack messages
• Interrupts you explaining to say ""JUST DO WHAT I SAID"" then later ""why didn't you think about X?""

• Writes ticket commens: ""fix the thing that's broken."" I fix it, then he goes ""why didn't you do it THIS way?"" Wth you never said what way??
• Rolls eyes and sighs dramatically when anyone disagrees
• Accused me of being ""unreachable"" because few times I took 1 hour to respond. He regularly ghosts for 2+ hours himself
• Super friendly in team chat, but in meetings with management he screen-shares our code and roasts us. ""Why is this so bad?"" ""Who wrote this garbage?"" Same code he approved btw
• Spends hours helping interns with basic Docker while actual sprint burns, then asks why we're behind
• Now making me come to office few days more to ""improve motivation."" Only he has issues with my work - business side and cto think I'm fine

The weirdest part is after besting me me for 30 mins straight in personal meeting, he'll switch to ""let's help each other improve 🙂"" mode like it is nothing.

Got no raise this year and a lot of people also in comaony, but somehow he got nice bump over this year.

My current position/job (Fintech) is such a disorganized mess, to the point that even my boss and +1 think I've been dealt a shit hand with my onboarding. I have not really been able to easily learn our systems and environments as nothing really makes sense and documentation leaves a lot to be desired (although there's more documentation here than at any other place I worked). I very much like the team and my boss and +1 are extremely chill, but I feel like I'm not learning and every week is just a gigantic frustration as I'm thrown some assignment that is some giant exception to how things work that neither senior nor +1 can easily figure out. They eventually do, but I don't really have much opportunity to learn then. Additionally, I was hired to do one thing but have been assigned to do a bunch of stuff that wasn't covered in the job description or the interview process and I really don't want to do them.

Maybe everything is this messy af but I wasn't fully aware until I actually had the title of Data Engineer.

The only position I voluntarily left was the Tax Department because of wanting to pursue data/CS. The following jobs I had had ended due to layoffs for COVID, economy, or whatever.

The Social Media Marketing startup was, in my opinion, a terrible mess with my being the sole data engineer siloed into the Marketing department and I'd have to work with other engineers in the actual data/tech department. Not bad per se, but they would often prioritize their responsibilities thus things couldn't be built in a timely manner. The times I received help, people with more knowledge on internal systems struggled to do what I was tasked with doing. I tried communicating this clearly to my boss, but I was laid off ""due to performance"".

As stated, the Freelance position is mostly made up, but I claim it to beef my experience since it was during the tech layoffs of late '22. I had been studying and doing small projects so I would be able to speak to what I've done and even have a couple of people who could ""attest"" for me, but no invoices or anything to show for it. I'm continuously studying and kinda working on a couple of projects. I get I could take it off, but I feel like I'd be fucked without it. It hasn't stopped me from getting both of the following jobs listed, and even has helped to get the newest job, so I plan to keep it on.

I get I'm concerned about job duration/hopping - I would want to stay at this current place if it were either more organized or if I weren't the least-paid person in the department. Fintech in NYC is a great opener to other opportunities. I think I can do better work but haven't been able to navigate this widely-acknowledged mess, and thus my pay will suffer.

1n1kii0,Why is human-computer interaction not more popular?,"Hello everyone,

During my CS course, we took several classes which broadly translate into ""jobs"", such as: Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Artificial Inteligence, Databases etc...

From all the courses I took, I found HCI to be the most interesting, as we got to build prototypes of interactive technologies from beginning to end, and validate them with users. I kinda fell in love with this discipline since it blended technical expertise with human factors. It also seemed to be of very practical application as the projects always ended in some kind of testable prototype.

However, I noticed it's probably the CS domain with fewer jobs, and the ones which exist, separate the ""computer"" skills from the ""human"" skills into different roles, killing what makes this specialization interesting in the first place. I also noticed it's not considered an attractive discipline amongst my CS peers.

In your opinion, what makes HCI feel so 'singled out', as a CS field?

1n1cgjh,"Hundreds of Applicants, One Role: A Tech Hiring Bloodbath","I work at a tech company in London, UK, and we recently opened up a junior developer position, which we posted online. Within minutes, applications started pouring in, tens of them right away, and within just two hours, we had hundreds. The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.

This really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there’s a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it’s unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.

If you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.

**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;

\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.

\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.

\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.

\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.

\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.

\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.

\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between £30k to £40k.

\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.

\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company’s internal recruitment information on the internet.

\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.

\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best.

1n1ptom,Career break? Yay or Nay?,"Hi everyone, I would like to hear some opnions from people more experienced than me.
I’ve been working at Microsoft (India) for about 5 years now. Got promoted to Senior.
However, I’ve been feeling burnt out and craving a career break of 3-5 months.

Would it be a wise decision to take a few months off? I plan to just spend time with my family, traveling but also studying about distributed systems in depth and prepping myself for the “second” phase of my career. Financials are not a problem. I have money saved to last me the next 5 years.

My current job is great. I feel valued. Salary is great. Work hours? Well, sometimes its 12+ hours a day but that’s not the norm. It’s a never ending cycle of highs and lows. 6 hour days followed by 12 hour days and so on…
But the feeling to say fuck it and chill for the next few months is so strong, I keep thinking about this question every couple of months.

Has anyone here taken a career break? What was your experience like? How hard was it to break into a tech role again? 
If you could share your experience, it would help me a lot.

Thank you!
PS: if anyone needs guidance or referrals ( up till mid level SWE), DM me. I get more satisfaction through helping people out than my job tbh.

He’s basically arguing that with the rise of AI and high-level automation, traditional CS education is becoming outdated — just like writing in Assembly is for most developers today.

1n1t4rh,Keep my current position or seek new opportunities?,"Hi I just need another opinion on this.

I am a current senior in college I currently work at a construction company doing IT tasks. Not helpdesk but more configuring / network engineering etc tasks.

My ultimate goal was becoming a software engineer but I have not had any luck with landing a swe internship yet. I decided to extend my graduation date to next December in order to fit in one last summer to try but now I’m reconsidering if that was the best idea given the current market.

My current role has amazing company culture, good benefits and a starting salary at 75k if I were to take their full time offer. There’s plenty of opportunity to move up the ladder. It would transition into a 6 figure salary within the next 3-5 years.

I have basic knowledge of MERN, created couple of projects from scratch, not copy, but made with my idea and creativity, code with a little help of AI, but both are fullstack applications, not just CRUD either. Have used jwt, oauth, RBAC, bcrypt and rate limiting in those apps and cors, its like thoda bahut knowledge hai inka. But I'm not so good at Js coding part I think. 

But here's the catch - Technical interviews need to be cleared as well, and I was studying Java from BCA, and have good core knowledge of it and do DSA in it, daily even. But I do not have much idea about its projects. Havent built any backend with it. That is why I am trying to learn Spring+Springboot. I like it but I see it can be kinda hard.

Also learning AWS for deployment and stuff. Have decent knowledge of networking and OS. (Also wanna learn postgre, yeah ik too much thinking together)

So I am so conflicted I am ready for all hard work (I have no option either way) but I wanna know which will be better, thing is time is low as well, a month or two before placements starts. In a tier 2 college, its okayish but have to compete with Btech bros as well. Worst part is I have no internships either.

I have mern projects and knowledge of how it works, not the best at writing code at it need help sometimes, I like java more but don't know SpringBoot or have made any projects in it. Time is scarce.

1n183uu,Is it really a problem to no longer be applying for jobs that don't appear to be ones I'll get?,"Several years ago, it seemed the mindset is they are only posting for the ideal candidate and you should apply anyway.  Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more. 

I know this looks negative and lazy, but the problem is that in the last 5-10 interviews, I've literally had no notes on what I could prepare for next time as 99% of what I prepared for wasn't even related to the interview, and all the questions were framed like, ""Do you know Spring Boot?  Do you know Angular?""  Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it.  

So, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. 

A bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.

I don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. 

So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.

Several years ago, it seemed the mindset is they are only posting for the ideal candidate and you should apply anyway.  Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more. 

I know this looks negative and lazy, but the problem is that in the last 5-10 interviews, I've literally had no notes on what I could prepare for next time as 99% of what I prepared for wasn't even related to the interview, and all the questions were framed like, ""Do you know Spring Boot?  Do you know Angular?""  Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it.  

So, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. 

A bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.

I don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. 

So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.

I was working for a team for long time, 3 years about and then I was unexpectedly told, hey we need you to move to this team to do some work. I was moved from Dev to QA Automation. Still within the same tree. But now after 2 months on the new team, I am being told, my velocity is too slow, I need too much help, im stuck on simplistic things, etc. and because of that, they are now placing me on a PIP.

I also had a separate meeting about my PIP where I express my concerns. My boss explained to me she MOVED me onto this team because it’s a dumpster fire. She told me “they don’t know write and deliver code, there needs to be guidance for the QA”. Etc. ALSO these people when they write commits write the most bare minimum simple messages. What I am trying to get at is I was transferred to a UNSTRUCTURED AWFUL SPAGHETTI CODE REPO.

My boss said oh you can do this, don’t worry. We need to see growth here, velocity increase here, and make sure you do all the trainings etc… but there is no growth at this company. No promotions. No motivation.

So what are my options? First, is this PIP even allowed after a transfer so short?

I’ve been interning at a company for almost 2yrs now (part time while in school, full time in the summers) and after talking with my manager I’m going to get a full-time offer. Probably by November or December.

My manager has expressed how I’ve been one of the most skilled interns they’ve had, etc.. my point being he really wants to hire me. So I’m trying to get other offers on the table so I can negotiate salary a bit.

Is this short timeframe from offer to expiration standard in the industry? If so, how do people get multiple offers without letting one expire??

Here are the options I’m considering:

	•	Double major with something like Econ for potential finance, banking, or business roles.

	•	Master’s in accounting, finance, or something similar.

	•	Transfer to Comp Eng or EE—but that seems tough since I’ve never taken physics.

1n0y12z,going for a Bachelor again or a Master?,"hi everyone. hope you're doing well.

 I'm 23M currently studying Nursery ( last year of a 4-year course). 

years ago I knew how to ""code"" basic stuff to make my tasks easier and more fun. I created my first 2d simple game at 10y/o, my first simple html css website 12 and so on . what I'm trying to say is I'm familiar with the programming world in a very very basic way and so far I've enjoyed the problem-solving part of it so much. I'm still using it for some of my tasks.

  
when I wanted to choose a field, I wanted to go for CS but because I was told about how the market is bad for cs, I decided to go for something more in demand and chose nursery, now after these years of studying I realized being in medical field is so hard and frustrating. no normal shifts and life to plan, toxic environments, SAME repetitive task over and over and over again... I want to try new things, CREATE new stuff and make things that didn't exist. treatment and care is not something I'd like to do for rest of my life. after finishing this degree, I don't want to work as a nurse. not even a SINGLE DAY.

  
now after finishing this degree, I want to go back to what I was good at but now I'm seeing how awful the market is. especially after this whole A.I trend. I'm seeing people with CS degrees struggling to land an entry-level job.

so I was thinking, is it better to go for a cs bachelor and spend 4 more years on it or a 2 years Master?

I wanted to go for the master and work on my resume but considering my non-related bachelor's I doubt I have a chance for future.

I was also thinking about going for a biomedical engineering master to maybe switch on more AI related careers in health system.

  
any advice?

I'm feeling stuck in my career and don't know what my next move is. I have been working in tech support since 2019, primary in the web-hosting space. While it's always been a grind with the nonstop chats/calls/tickets, I legitimately enjoyed it at first for the first two years or so. My first company was awesome. They are one of the best web hosts to work for. I was a level 2 tech and a top performer, easily knocking out 80+ chats a day. My manager would constantly tell me how good of a job I was doing. Despite that, I struggled to afford living in the city the company was based in. I eventually asked for a raise and was offered a one thousand dollar per YEAR raise. It wasn't sustainable to keep waiting around for an actual raise, so I quit very shortly after that to move to a major cloud computing company as a cloud support engineer. I ended up hating that company almost immediately because of their lack of training, vague protocols, poor documentation and how they clearly viewed their support department as an after thought. Only 2 or 3 months out of training, they laid off 10% of their staff including me.

I've since landed a different job at another web host as a support manager. I thought I would enjoy this role but truth be told I absolutely despise my job and my company. I feel that my work is meaningless and repetitive. The agents under me are basically un-coachable and uninspired. The tech debt is immense. The higher ups are too focused on pushing out half baked products that barely work. Our back end infrastructure is a nightmare. I spend most of my time troubleshooting stuff that should have been fixed years ago, yet engineering has no plans of doing so. 

Essentially, I'm stuck in support hell.

I really like working with computers but the past three years have left me feeling so drained that I hardly have the energy to upskill and find a better, non-customer facing role. I don't like working in tech support and I don't like working in tech support management. I constantly think about working on certs to get a job as an SRE or DevOps engineer, but I'm worried that I'd find myself in the same position of not finding any satisfaction in it. Plus the tech market is so competitive now that I feel like I don't know where to even start. I'm left with the question of ""do I want to leave the tech world or do I just hate working in support?""

I’m a software engineer who needs a mission both to live and to work for. After 11 years of experience, I’ve realized that working for a non-profit organization with a shared mission could really give me a lot of motivation.

So, I found a company that also offers a salary in line with my expectations, and I decided to apply.

1n02kl3,Help - how do I take the next step without breaking?,"\[Senior DevOps Engineer, 17 YOE\]

Hi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.

I'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.

At work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.

While management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the ""senior founder dev"" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.

It has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( 

I've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to ""catch up"" and but I never quite get there...

And outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?

What I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.

Hi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.

I'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.

At work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.

While management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the ""senior founder dev"" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.

It has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( 

I've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to ""catch up"" and but I never quite get there...

And outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?

What I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.

*tldr; my life isn't perfect, but I'm still here fighting - but there is no joy left and I've lost myself.*

1m1uw9v,"I just watched an AI agent take a Jira ticket, understand our codebase, and push a PR in minutes and I’m genuinely scared","I’m a professional software engineer, and today something happened that honestly shook me. I watched an AI agent, part of an internally built tool our company is piloting, take in a small Jira ticket. It was the kind of task that would usually take me or a teammate about an hour. Mostly writing a SQL query and making a small change to some backend code.

The AI read through our codebase, figured out the context, wrote the query, updated the code, created a PR with a clear diff and a well-written description, and pushed it for review. All in just a few minutes.

This wasn’t boilerplate. It followed our naming conventions, made logical decisions, and even updated a test. One of our senior engineers reviewed the PR and said it looked solid and accurate. They would have done it the same way.

What really hit me is that this isn’t some future concept. This AI tool is being gradually rolled out across teams in our org as part of a pilot program. And it’s already producing results like this.

I’ve been following AI developments, but watching it do my job in my codebase made everything feel real in a way headlines never could. It was a ticket I would have knocked out before lunch, and now it’s being done faster and with less effort by a machine.

I’m not saying engineers will be out of jobs tomorrow. But if an AI can already handle these kinds of everyday tickets, we’re looking at serious changes in the near future. Maybe not in years, but in months.

Let me tell you about my buddy. Until a few months ago, he had a job as a software engineer at an insurance company. The benefits were fantastic.. he would work 10-20 hours a week at most, work was very chill and relaxing. His coworkers and management were nice and welcoming, and the company was very stable and recession proof. He also only had to go into the office once a week. He had time to go to the gym, spend time with family, and even work on side projects if he felt like it

But then he got tempted by the FAANG name and the idea of a shiny new title and what looked like better pay and more exciting projects, so he made the jump, thinking he was leveling up, thinking he was finally joining the big leagues

From day one it was a completely different world, the job was fully on-site so he was back to commuting every day, the hours were brutal, and even though nobody said it out loud there was a very clear expectation to be constantly online, constantly responsive, and always pushing for more

He went from having quiet mornings and freedom to structure his day to 8 a.m. standups, nonstop back-to-back meetings, toxic coworkers who acted like they were in some competition for who could look the busiest, and managers who micromanaged every last detail while pretending to be laid-back

He was putting in 50 to 60 hours a week just trying to stay afloat and it was draining the life out of him, but he kept telling himself it was worth it for the resume boost and the name recognition and then just three months in, he got the layoff email

No warning, no internal transfer, no fallback plan, just a cold goodbye and a severance package, and now he’s sitting at home unemployed in a terrible market, completely burned out, regretting ever leaving that insurance job where people actually treated each other like human beings

And the worst part is I watched him change during those months, it was like the light in him dimmed a little every week, he started looking tired all the time, less present, shorter on the phone, always distracted, talking about how he felt like he was constantly behind, constantly proving himself to people who didn’t even know his name

He used to be one of the most relaxed, easygoing guys I knew, always down for a beer or a pickup game or just to chill and talk about life, but during those months it felt like he aged five years, and when he finally called me after the layoff it wasn’t just that he lost the job, it was like he’d lost a piece of himself in the process

To make it worse, his old role was already filled, and it’s not like you can just snap your fingers and go back, that bridge is gone, and now he’s in this weird limbo where he’s applying like crazy but everything is frozen or competitive or worse, fake listings meant to fish for resumes

I’ve seen this happen to more than one person lately and I’m telling you, if you’re in a solid job right now with decent pay, decent hours, and a company that isn’t on fire, you don’t need to chase the dream of some big tech title especially not in a market like this

1mrujpf,4 years at Big tech. Being likeable beats being productive every single time,"**TL;DR: Grinding harder made me less productive AND less likeable. Being calm is the actual cheat code.**

I'm 4 years deep at a big tech company, and work-life balance has been absolutely brutal lately. For the past year, I went full psycho mode—trying to crush every single task, racing through my backlog, saying yes to everything.

**Plot twist: It made me objectively worse at my job.**

Here's what I didn't expect: When you're constantly in panic mode, your nervous system goes haywire. You become that coworker who's stressed, short with people, and honestly just not fun to be around.

**And here's the kicker—being pleasant to work with is literally the most important skill in Big Tech.**

Think about it: The people who get shit done aren't grinding alone in a corner. They're the ones other people WANT to help. They get faster code reviews. They get invited to the important meetings. They get context shared with them freely.

Being likeable beats being productive every single time **TL;DR: Grinding harder made me less productive AND less likeable. Being calm is the actual cheat code.**

I'm 4 years deep at a big tech company, and work-life balance has been absolutely brutal lately. For the past year, I went full psycho mode—trying to crush every single task, racing through my backlog, saying yes to everything.

**Plot twist: It made me objectively worse at my job.**

Here's what I didn't expect: When you're constantly in panic mode, your nervous system goes haywire. You become that coworker who's stressed, short with people, and honestly just not fun to be around.

**And here's the kicker—being pleasant to work with is literally the most important skill in Big Tech.**

Think about it: The people who get shit done aren't grinding alone in a corner. They're the ones other people WANT to help. They get faster code reviews. They get invited to the important meetings. They get context shared with them freely.

1mk8zj6,The fact that ChatGPT 5 is barely an improvement shows that AI won't replace software engineers.,"I’ve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it’s evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It’s like we’re hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.

That’s a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn’t there yet.

So yeah, the tech is cool and it’ll keep getting better, but the progress isn’t revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers’ lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It’s great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won’t be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.

I know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.

1jvk5td,Why I left big tech and plan on never coming back.. EVER.,"I used to think landing a job at a big tech company would be the peak of my career. Everyone made it sound like once you got in, your life was set. Prestige, money, smart people, meaningful work. I bought into the whole thing. I worked my ass off to get there. Leetcode, system design prep, referrals, rejection after rejection. And when I finally got the offer, I remember feeling like I had won the lottery.

That feeling didn’t last long.

What I stepped into was one of the most toxic, mentally draining environments I’ve ever experienced. It didn’t happen all at once. It crept in. The first few weeks were exciting, but then the cracks started to show. The pressure was insane. The deadlines were borderline delusional. There was this unspoken expectation to be available at all times. Messages late at night. Work bleeding into weekends. No one ever said it out loud, but if you wanted to be seen as serious, as someone who ""got it,"" you had to sacrifice everything else.

The culture was a constant performance. I couldn’t just do my job. I had to sell it. Everything I worked on needed a narrative. Every project had to be spun into something that could fit neatly into a promotion packet or a perf review. I wasn’t building software. I was building a case to not be forgotten. Because every quarter, someone got labeled as underperforming. It didn’t always make sense who it was. Sometimes it was the quietest person on the team. Sometimes it was someone who just had the wrong skip manager. Everyone smiled in meetings but no one felt safe.

The politics were unbearable. Influence mattered more than clarity. Visibility mattered more than functionality. Everything had to be socialized in just the right way to just the right people. One wrong Slack message or a poorly timed piece of feedback could nuke months of work. And if you didn’t know how to play the game, it didn’t matter how smart or hardworking you were. You were dead in the water.

Work-life balance was a joke. I was constantly anxious, constantly behind, constantly checking messages like something was going to blow up if I missed a ping. I stopped sleeping properly. I stopped seeing friends. I stopped caring about things I used to love. My weekends were spent recovering from the week and bracing for the next one. And the whole time I kept telling myself it was temporary. That it would get better. That if I just made it to the next level, it would all be worth it.

But it never got better. The pressure just got worse. The bar kept moving. The layoffs started. The reorganizations. The endless leadership changes. Half my team vanished in one cycle. I remember joining a Zoom call one morning and realizing I didn’t even know who my manager reported to anymore. People were disappearing mid-project. Morale was a punchline. Everyone was scared but pretending they weren’t. Everyone was tired but still smiling in team standups. I started to feel like I was losing my grip.

When I finally left, I didn’t feel free. I felt broken. It took months before I stopped checking my calendar every morning out of reflex. I still have dreams about unfinished sprints and last-minute roadmap changes. I still flinch when I see a Slack notification.

People glamorize these jobs because of the compensation and the brand names. But no one talks about the cost. I gave that place everything and it chewed through me like I was nothing.

EVER. I used to think landing a job at a big tech company would be the peak of my career. Everyone made it sound like once you got in, your life was set. Prestige, money, smart people, meaningful work. I bought into the whole thing. I worked my ass off to get there. Leetcode, system design prep, referrals, rejection after rejection. And when I finally got the offer, I remember feeling like I had won the lottery.

That feeling didn’t last long.

What I stepped into was one of the most toxic, mentally draining environments I’ve ever experienced. It didn’t happen all at once. It crept in. The first few weeks were exciting, but then the cracks started to show. The pressure was insane. The deadlines were borderline delusional. There was this unspoken expectation to be available at all times. Messages late at night. Work bleeding into weekends. No one ever said it out loud, but if you wanted to be seen as serious, as someone who ""got it,"" you had to sacrifice everything else.

The culture was a constant performance. I couldn’t just do my job. I had to sell it. Everything I worked on needed a narrative. Every project had to be spun into something that could fit neatly into a promotion packet or a perf review. I wasn’t building software. I was building a case to not be forgotten. Because every quarter, someone got labeled as underperforming. It didn’t always make sense who it was. Sometimes it was the quietest person on the team. Sometimes it was someone who just had the wrong skip manager. Everyone smiled in meetings but no one felt safe.

The politics were unbearable. Influence mattered more than clarity. Visibility mattered more than functionality. Everything had to be socialized in just the right way to just the right people. One wrong Slack message or a poorly timed piece of feedback could nuke months of work. And if you didn’t know how to play the game, it didn’t matter how smart or hardworking you were. You were dead in the water.

Work-life balance was a joke. I was constantly anxious, constantly behind, constantly checking messages like something was going to blow up if I missed a ping. I stopped sleeping properly. I stopped seeing friends. I stopped caring about things I used to love. My weekends were spent recovering from the week and bracing for the next one. And the whole time I kept telling myself it was temporary. That it would get better. That if I just made it to the next level, it would all be worth it.

But it never got better. The pressure just got worse. The bar kept moving. The layoffs started. The reorganizations. The endless leadership changes. Half my team vanished in one cycle. I remember joining a Zoom call one morning and realizing I didn’t even know who my manager reported to anymore. People were disappearing mid-project. Morale was a punchline. Everyone was scared but pretending they weren’t. Everyone was tired but still smiling in team standups. I started to feel like I was losing my grip.

When I finally left, I didn’t feel free. I felt broken. It took months before I stopped checking my calendar every morning out of reflex. I still have dreams about unfinished sprints and last-minute roadmap changes. I still flinch when I see a Slack notification.

People glamorize these jobs because of the compensation and the brand names. But no one talks about the cost. I gave that place everything and it chewed through me like I was nothing. Just another seat to fill. Just another cog in the machine. I left with more money, sure. But I also left with burnout, insomnia, and a genuine hatred for the industry I used to be passionate about.

1fzzvj5,Why No One Wants Junior Engineers,"Here's a not-so-secret: no one wants junior engineers.

AI! Outsourcing! A bad economy! Diploma/certificate mill training! Over saturation!

All of those play some part of the story. But here's what people tend to overlook: no one **ever** wanted junior engineers.

When it's you looking for that entry-level job, you can make arguments about the work ethic you're willing to bring, the things you already know, and the value you can provide for your salary. These are really nice arguments, but here's the big problem:

Have you ever seen a company of *predominantly* junior engineers?

If junior devs were such a great value -- they work for less, they work more hours, and they bring lots of intensity -- then there would be an arbitrage opportunity where instead of hiring a team of diverse experience you could bias heavily towards juniors. You could maybe hire 8 juniors to every 1 senior team lead and be on the path to profits.

You won't find that model working anywhere; and that's why no one want junior developers -- *you're just not that profitable*.

**UNLESS**...you can grow into a mid-level engineer. And then keep going and grow into a senior engineer. And keep going into Staff and Principle and all that.

Junior Engineers get hired not for what they know, not for what they can do, but for the person that they can become.

If you're out there job hunting or thinking about entering this industry, you've got to build a compelling case for yourself. It's not one of ""wow look at all these bullet points on my resume"" because your current knowledge isn't going to get you very far. The story you have to tell is ""here's where I am and where I'm headed on my growth curve."" This is how I push myself. This is how I get better. This is what I do when I don't know what to do. This is how I collaborate, give, and get feedback.

That's what's missing when the advice around here is to crush Leetcodes until your eyes bleed. Your technical skills today are important, but they're not good enough to win you a job. You've got to show that you're going somewhere, you're becoming someone, and that person will be incredibly valuable.",2737,0.93,633,2024-10-09 22:28:43,jcasimir,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1fzzvj5/why_no_one_wants_junior_engineers/,True,0,False,False,22,Wednesday,2024-10-09,2024-10,0.23119065010956902,588.69,"Why No One Wants Junior Engineers Here's a not-so-secret: no one wants junior engineers.

1k4dbtu,I gave up after 2 years and took the easy way out,"I was laid off in May 2023. I have 10 YOE, CS degree, and am a US citizen. I spent 4 years in the startup world as a Frontend Developer and 6 years at a F500 as a Senior Fullstack Engineer.

Over the last two years I made it to 18 final rounds. I lost count of the amount of applications and interviews total. I was always just a bit short on aligning perfectly with their stack, a year too short on a certain technology, wrong cloud platform, etc. I got a part-time job, lived frugally, stretched my emergency savings / severance and told myself that the next one would surely be the one.

I hid my unemployment from my family out of shame for 2 years. Then when April came around I was staring down the barrel of my 2 year mark of employment with nothing left in my savings.

1i8p6am,Hacks to get hired at Amazon,"Hey, I’m a software engineer at Amazon and want to share some hacks on getting hired.

Couple points: 
1) Please do not message me
2) I have participated in many interviews, this is my experience, the morals of these cheats or whether you have success is up to you.



 First, the coding rounds (not including OA) does not allow you to run your code, it’s basically a blank text editor. Many interviewers cannot really tell if your code will run, they just see if it “looks correct”. I’ve seen a lot of candidates get hired by borderline writing pseudocode. The lesson here is to waste zero time wondering about nit-picky details like if your loop is off by one, or what that built in method to convert an int to a string is… they care about SPEED and just that you have the right idea.

Second, Amazon treats their LPs like the holy texts. But the only thing that really matters is delivering to please your superiors no matter what.

Couple points: 
1) Please do not message me
2) I have participated in many interviews, this is my experience, the morals of these cheats or whether you have success is up to you.



 First, the coding rounds (not including OA) does not allow you to run your code, it’s basically a blank text editor. Many interviewers cannot really tell if your code will run, they just see if it “looks correct”. I’ve seen a lot of candidates get hired by borderline writing pseudocode. The lesson here is to waste zero time wondering about nit-picky details like if your loop is off by one, or what that built in method to convert an int to a string is… they care about SPEED and just that you have the right idea.

Second, Amazon treats their LPs like the holy texts. But the only thing that really matters is delivering to please your superiors no matter what. This means put customer obsession, deliver results, and ownership above all else. These are the rules you live by. You tell these people that you skipped Christmas because you had to fix an open source dependency to unblock some random guy in Indian if you have to…

I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I feel like all the tech ""influencers"" of 2021 glamorized this career to unrealistic expectations, and I need to correct some of the preconceived notions.

The last 3 years have been absolutely brutal in terms of declining engineering culture. What's worse is that the toxicity is creating a feedback loops that exacerbates the declining culture.

Some of the crazy things I've heard

* ""If that person doesn't have the right skills, get rid of them and we'll find someone that does"" (VP to an entire organization after pivoting technology direction). 
   * I.e. - It's not worth training people anymore, even if they're talented and can learn anything new. It's all sink or swim now
* ""If these candidates aren't willing to grind hundreds of leetcode questions, they don't have mental fortitude to handle this job"" (engineers to other engineers)
   * To be fair, I felt like this was a defense mechanism. The amount of BS that you need to put up with to not get laid off has grown significantly.

   * I've always felt this pressure previously. But I've never heard it truly be verbalized until recently.

* Software engineering in big tech feels more akin to investment banking now. Most companies expect this to be your life. You truly have to be ""passionate"" about making a bunch of money, or ""passionate"" about the product to survive.

1ji30u4,Big Tech Isn’t the Dream Anymore. It’s a Trap,"I used to believe that working at FAANG was the ultimate goal. Back in the day, getting an offer from one of these companies meant you had made it. It was a badge of honor, proof that you were one of the best engineers out there. And for a long time, FAANG jobs actually were amazing: good work, smart people, great stability. But that’s not the case anymore. In just the last couple of years, things have changed dramatically. If you’re still grinding Leetcode and dreaming of getting in, you should know that the FAANG people talk about online, the one from five or ten years ago, doesn’t exist anymore. What exists now is a toxic, cutthroat, anxiety-inducing mess that isn’t worth it.

At first, I thought maybe it was just me. Maybe I had bad luck with teams or managers. But no, the more I talked to coworkers and friends at different FAANG companies, the clearer it became. Every company, every team, every engineer is feeling the same thing. The stress. The fear. The constant uncertainty. These companies used to be places where you could coast a little, focus on doing good work, and feel reasonably safe in your job. Now? It’s a pressure cooker, and it’s only getting worse.

The layoffs are brutal. And they’re not just one-time events, they’re a constant, looming threat. It used to be that getting a job at FAANG meant you were set for years. Now, people get hired and fired within months. Teams are gutted overnight, sometimes with no warning at all. Engineers who have been working their asses off, doing great work, suddenly find themselves jobless for reasons that make no sense. It’s not about performance. It’s not about skill. It’s about whatever arbitrary cost-cutting measures leadership decides on to make the stock price look good that quarter.

And if you’re not laid off? You’re stuck in a worse situation. The same amount of work or more now gets dumped on fewer people. Everyone is constantly in survival mode, trying to prove they deserve to stay because nobody knows when the next round of cuts is coming. It creates this suffocating environment where nobody trusts anyone. Engineers aren’t helping each other because doing so might mean the other person gets ahead of them in the next performance review. Managers are terrified because they know they’re just as disposable, so they push their teams harder and harder, hoping that if they hit all their metrics, they won’t be next.

It used to be that you could work at FAANG and just do your job. You didn’t have to be a politician, you didn’t have to constantly justify your own existence, you didn’t have to be paranoid about everything you did. Now? It’s a game of survival, and the worst part is that you don’t even control whether you win or lose. Your project could be perfectly aligned with company goals one day, and the next, leadership decides to kill it and lay off half the people working on it. Nothing you do actually matters when decisions are being made at that level.

And forget about work-life balance. A few years ago, FAANG companies actually cared about this, at least on the surface. They gave you flexibility, good benefits, and a culture that encouraged taking time off when you needed it. But now? It’s all out the window. The expectation is that you’re always online, always grinding, always proving your worth because if you don’t, you might not have a job tomorrow. And the worst part? It’s not even leading to better products. All this stress, all this pressure, and the companies aren’t even innovating like they used to. It’s just a mess of half-baked projects, short-term thinking, and leadership flailing around trying to look like they have a plan when they clearly don’t.

I used to think the only way to have a good career in software was to get into FAANG. But the truth is, non-tech companies are a way better place to be right now. The best-kept secret in this industry is that banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, and even old-school manufacturing firms need engineers just as much as FAANG does, but they actually treat them like human beings. The work is more stable, the expectations are lower, and the stress is way lower. People actually log off at 5. They actually take vacations. They actually have lives outside of work.

If you’re still dreaming of FAANG, hoping that getting in will make your career perfect, wake up. It’s not the dream anymore. It’s a trap. And once you get in, you’ll realize just how quickly it can turn into a nightmare. The job security is gone. The work-life balance is gone. The collaboration and innovation are gone. If you want a career where you can actually enjoy your life, look somewhere else. FAANG isn’t worth it anymore.

***I also want to tell you WHY the reality in the real world does not match the fake narrative on this subreddit.***

Pay attention to the comments you’re about to see. You’ll hear a lot of people insisting that everything I’m saying is wrong. That Big Tech is still as great as it’s always been. That layoffs are rare, and work-life balance is just as good as it’s always been. But here’s the thing ask yourself, who are the people saying this? Who are the ones telling you that Big Tech is the dream?

In nearly every case, these people are brand new to the industry. Fresh grads. People with barely a year or two of experience under their belts. The truth is, they don’t know any better. They’re still caught up in the honeymoon phase, believing in the myth because they haven’t experienced the grind, the stress, or the reality of Big Tech's toxic culture. They haven’t seen what it’s really like once the rose-colored glasses come off. They’ve been sold a dream a carefully crafted image of what life at Big Tech *should* be. And they’re happily buying into it, not realizing they’ve been fed a lie.

These are the same people who’ve only had a glimpse of what working at Big Tech can be like. And that’s all they need to sing its praises they haven't had to stay long enough to experience the burnout, the layoffs, or the soul-crushing fear that comes with constantly being on the chopping block. They've been treated like royalty for a year or two, and they think they’ve made it. But let me tell you real experience, the kind that comes from working in this industry for several years, will open your eyes to the truth. And it’s not pretty.

Look at the facts. Engineers leave Big Tech after just a year because the culture is unsustainable. They realize the stability they were promised doesn’t exist. The work-life balance they were sold is a lie. The so-called “innovation” is nothing more than endless churn, half-baked projects, and pressure to deliver results at any cost. It’s not the dream these new grads think it is it’s a pressure cooker where you’re just another cog in a machine that doesn’t care about you. And once you’re in, it’s hard to escape.

So before you buy into the hype, take a step back. Consider the bigger picture. Why is it that so many experienced professionals are fleeing Big Tech? Why do they jump ship to industries like banking, healthcare, and manufacturing industries that don’t carry the same glamour but offer stability, work-life balance, and respect for their employees? They’ve seen the reality behind the curtain, and they know it’s not worth it anymore.

Now, think about this: The new grads in the comments? They haven’t seen that yet. They haven’t lived it. They’re parroting what they’ve been told or what they wish was true. But when the layoffs hit, when the stress becomes unbearable, when they start working 60-70 hour weeks to keep their job, they’ll understand. Until then, they’ll continue to claim Big Tech is a dream, because they haven’t been there long enough to realize that it’s a nightmare.

The numbers don’t lie. People leave. And when they leave, they don’t look back. They go to places where their work is valued, where they can actually *live* their lives. They leave because they know the truth Big Tech is a trap, a fleeting dream that turns into a nightmare as soon as you realize how disposable you really are.

So, before you drink the Kool-Aid, ask yourself: Why do so many of these new grads stay only a year or two before they burn out? Why is the turnover rate so high? Why do they look for jobs outside Big Tech? These are all questions worth considering. The truth is staring us in the face, but too many people are too caught up in the shiny promises to see it. Don’t let yourself fall into the same trap. Don’t buy into the lies being sold to you. Because once you're in, it’s not so easy to get out. And when you’re stuck, it can feel like you’re fighting for your survival.

1kslf3b,"After 4 years at Google, here's my honest take on why their work culture and processes didn't work for me.","I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.

Just to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.

# Agile is a Sin

I come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?

Wrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.

It is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.

Also, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for ""X"" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.

So, if you're not regularly shipping software, how can you possibly measure impact?

Docs.

Endless docs.

Countless docs.

So many docs that it can be impossible to find what doc says what you did.

Google's mission is to ""organize the world's information."" Internally in Google, they generate a lot of information in docs, and it's very hard to search and find the information you're looking for.

What's the point of docs no one reads? Well, since software doesn't get shipped, I assume it just acts as a laundry list of links when attempting to show impact for your performance reviews or promotions. You might not have shipped anything, but at least you left a paper trail of what you didn't ship.

You want to know the worst part of it? They want you to write a doc on a system you don't understand. So you write it up, make some assumptions and send it out for approval. No one reads it to approve it. Let's say you get your single approver and start implementing. Guess what, your core assumption is wrong. The data isn't in the right place, or the data you thought had what you needed, doesn't. Now you need to rewrite the doc.

What's the point of getting approval? What's the point of a doc that is wrong from the start? What's the point of upfront design that is wrong? Why not just implement and find out what actually is going on and make it work?

The point is, it's just theater to make it look like we're doing our jobs. Why isn't the software the evidence we're doing our job?

I'm not trying to say docs are bad, and everything should just be tribal knowledge. But I am saying docs that need to be rewritten from the get-go are a waste of time.

# Bad docs

Ironically, despite needing to write so many docs to implement things. When you read other people's docs, you might notice something. They're very high-level. They're more like a thesis, then like actual documentation on how to use an API.

What is the point of docs that don't answer how to use an API?

Focusing on the high-level philosophy of a service is honestly distracting and unhelpful. I think I understand why this happens. It's hard to keep docs up to date. So if you keep them high-level, they won't become obsolete or need to be updated. But I don't care about your thesis defense; I just want to use your software to solve my problem.

And I know Google can write good docs. [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) has fantastic documentation. [Proto Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview/) have great docs. Both of these are made by Google. I guess the difference is they're public facing and Google doesn't prioritize internal docs like they do their external facing ones.

# A Culture of Silence

So, there is a lot of lip service towards how open Google is. Say how they're trying to encourage employees in fireside chats to not ask anonymous questions so that leadership can follow up with the individual to gain more context. (This, by the way, does not prevent people from asking anonymously, which they do.)

There is also a culture of no-blame retrospectives. They don't run regularly, even when I advocate for them. And worst of all, when we finally do run retrospectives, we don't discuss challenges and problems we are encountering. So, what's the point of a retrospective that doesn't talk about pain points and mitigation strategies? From my perspective, it just looks like theater and a way to paint a false view that everything is good and we have nothing to complain about. Or worse, that we are helpless and we really cannot change anything.

Coming from companies with genuinely open cultures where we fostered candid and open discussions, it's baffling to me that no one seems willing to put in the minimal effort to improve everyone's lives.

It is better to be positive about a broken system and keep the status quo than it is to ask people to put in a laughable small level of effort to make everyone's life better. Not everything is going smoothly all the time. And assuming we **want** it to run smoothly, we should probably discuss the pain points and workarounds or solutions to them. Knowledge silos are bad. More open discussions can reduce knowledge silos which reduces the burden on individuals and gives everyone a balance for job responsibilities.

# A Culture of Bottom-Up (but only if it's top-down)

So, in meetings with leadership. They emphasize that our *bottom-up culture* is how we do such great work. And by *bottom-up*, they apparently mean *top-down*.

# When Bottom-Up Meets Brick Wall

So, let's say our UXR (user experience research team) has come up with an obvious gap in our offerings. What would you do? Perhaps gather some people from multiple disciplines and brainstorm a solution. Or maybe you just get leadership and design in a room and iterate on who knows what behind closed doors for literal months, before you ever even involve engineering. And for those few months, you pull engineering off their current teams in a large-scale reorg and don't give them marching orders instead just give them a bunch of vague ideas of what they might want to build. Like...what is engineering supposed to do? Build against an invisible moving target? The answer is, that is exactly what we do. Not because it's a good use of our time, but because we have nothing better to do and we have no input into the vision of the product.

So let's say, you're an engineer, like yours truly, and you think that process is stupid, and instead you really do want to try to implement a bottoms up initiative. So maybe, see a feature, we originally spec'd out but was dropped because they didn't see the current value in implementing it. But it sounds kind of cool, and shouldn't be that difficult to get an MVP for this feature. Maybe you go to reach out across teams, pull in people that own data you need, a team that works on Android and iOS, and try to get people from the backend team so you can make an e2e MVP to demonstrate this feature is doable. Also, act as a test bed to show smaller agile processes work and probably how we should handle work in the org.

Sounds pretty encouraging, right? But here is the real problem, one of the teams is a no-show. Not only are they a no-show, they also refuse to work with you and ignore your messages. You escalate to your manager and tech lead, and that team also ignores them too. You work with the other teams and implement everything, but say the one thing to tie everything together and make it work e2e. Let's say a backend team refused to work with you. So, naturally, offer to do the work for them. And they tell you to not do that. Because it's not my code base, I'm not on call, and I don't have to maintain it. So what do you do?

What I did was create a video demo that made it look like it should work and presented it to leadership. We were reorged before this demo was even presented, so the feature died on the vine.

# The Only MVP Is Minimum Viable Plausible Deniability

Let's say that you do still believe in the rhetoric that, *the organization really does believe in bottom-up*. So you take some time and write up a doc (which is an activity you don't enjoy but if that's how the game is played, and you want to play ball, you do it). The doc outlines an open source initiative that is coincidentally attempting to solve the space we just tried to fill. But since there's an open-source community trying to solve the same problem space, maybe we can just leverage that and even help them grow at the same time. Anyway, it was super nice to have leadership hear me out, but they didn't want to go with it, because it turns out that one of the reasons we hamstrung our last project was because we were attempting to skirt a legal definition that the open source project is tackling head on. Suddenly, it made more sense: The original project was destined to fail, not because it was a bad idea, but because they were trying to handicap the implementation to avoid legal scrutiny.

Fundamentally, we're not trying to build good software or solve problems. We're just trying to do something without bringing legal scrutiny to Google.

I understand getting sued sucks, and the law is often weaponized against Google. But why handicap ourselves? There are so many other ideas out there. Why not pursue things that are higher value and lower risk? I cynically believe it could just be virtue signaling to investors, to show Google is trying new things and still taking risks. But their risks seem high-risk, low-reward, compared to the normal practices I'm used to, which focus on mitigating risk and prioritizing high value. Taking risks here seems to be about signaling growth, but are they truly growing? Wouldn't the more obvious path be to take the calculated legal risk to solve a real problem and potentially achieve genuine growth? I don't know; I'm not in leadership. I just had a worm's-eye view of the machine.

# Grassroots Agility, Stomped by Apathy

Let's say you came from an agile background and you even believe it. Because you've seen it solve very obvious communication issues that you see arise in large organizations. You've experienced it firsthand, you know it works. You go and explain it to your manager, they say that there are organization issues and leadership is resistant to change. They don't discourage you from trying, but they kind of set the expectations that nothing will change. But, what else are you supposed to do? Nothing?

So you have a meeting with your skip manager (your manager's manager) once again advocating to adopt agile processes and maybe get more stakeholder buy-in. And they give you the advice to do it locally with your team. You know, ""bottom-up"" kind of stuff.

You present it to the team. They hate it. They don't want processes. They don't want collaboration or more communication. They say agile practices are dehumanizing and that we are not interchangeable cogs in the machine. A bit of a disservice towards agile processes. But they are willing to try some of the ceremonies.

But literally, for any reason whatsoever, they cancel meetings, like retrospectives or stand-ups. Maybe we need more time to finish a feature, or maybe it's a holiday, or we get reorged. And we never start up the meeting again, at least until I ask for it. Followed by it once again being canceled at the drop of a hat. And no one cares. They don't see the value in it. And to be honest, the ceremonies are toothless because we don't discuss actual problems, we don't discuss work progress to reduce knowledge silos, and action items are never done and are also usually not meaningful anyway.

The reason people don't see the value of agile processes is not that it's not a good framework to address communication gaps, but because just doing the ceremonies without the communication makes them pointless. There is value in the ceremonies if they're being used to address the problems. But actively ignoring the problems, even with ceremonies, means we're now just wasting people's time.

# Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Going Nowhere

If there is a bottom-up culture at Google, it is self sabotaging. There is so much momentum for the status quo that actual process change is near impossible. The only change that appears to work is a top-down mandate, which they try every year with constant reorgs and get the same results.

# There is No Team in I

So, coming from an agile background (I know I sound like I'm in a cult, with how much I bring it up, but bear with me), I've come to the understanding that I as an individual do not necessarily matter. It's about putting aside ego and working together on a larger goal. This also comes with a nice benefit of distributing responsibility, and reducing burn out.

That's pretty damn *ungoogley*. At Google, they're rugged cowboys. They pull themselves up by the bootstrap and don't care about your collaboration. You need to own everything. Your work, your feature, your project, your process, your career. No one is here to help you. You need to just do it yourself. Which is ironic, as [googley-ness](https://staffeng.medium.com/being-googly-62b75dd642df) should theoretically not embody it. But the performance evaluation surely doesn't emphasize trying to make teamwork work.

[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.

I hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.

It could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *""leaning on others too much.""* How else am I supposed to read that?

I've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.

# Performative Theater

I hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.

1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.

So, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.

When they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.

# Tech Debt Forever

To say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.

Cryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.

So I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, ""It sounds like you need mentorship."" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, ""maybe you should find your own mentorship."" And it does make me wonder, ""what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?"" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.

# I'm out

So I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.

They gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.

There is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.

I used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",2352,0.96,385,2025-05-22 11:13:58,dethstrobe,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kslf3b/after_4_years_at_google_heres_my_honest_take_on/,True,0,False,False,11,Thursday,2025-05-22,2025-05,0.16362090947726307,369.59999999999997,"After 4 years at Google, here's my honest take on why their work culture and processes didn't work for me. I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.

Just to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.

# Agile is a Sin

I come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?

Wrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.

It is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.

Also, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for ""X"" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.

[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.

I hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.

It could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *""leaning on others too much.""* How else am I supposed to read that?

I've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.

# Performative Theater

I hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.

1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.

So, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.

When they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.

# Tech Debt Forever

To say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.

Cryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.

So I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, ""It sounds like you need mentorship."" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, ""maybe you should find your own mentorship."" And it does make me wonder, ""what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?"" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.

# I'm out

So I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.

They gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.

There is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.

I used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",106,21188,21295,0.115,0.782,0.103,-0.9903,Negative,True,True,True

1fyf5fo,[ Mind Blowing ] What my friend's inter view process was like as an Accountant compared to me as a Software Engineer.,"So, me and my friend recently decided to switch jobs, and our experiences were extremely different. So much so, that it has me really questioning my entire life.

Some background:

* We both have similar years of experience (nearly 6 years)
* My friend has his CPA 
* We both started looking roughly around the same time (around the mid point of this year)

My experience as a Software Engineer

* I spent the first 2 months grinding LeetCode, System Design and brushing up on OOP concepts. I've done this before, so it was mainly a refresher / review
   * Did Grind75
   * Skimmed through Alex Su's System Design books
   * Went through HelloInter view's System Design
   * Did Grokking the Object Oriented Design Inter view
* I've applied to roughly 150 positions (tailoring my resume per job application, hence the ""low"" number of applications)
* I've heard back from 25 different companies
* 20 of these companies had an initial OA
   * On average, 2 LeetCode mediums with the occasional LeetCode hard
   * Sometimes had a light system design quiz as well
* The remaining 5 had a more typical phone screen inter view, where I was asked some behavioural stuff and 1-2 LeetCode questions (mediums, sometimes hard) in a live setting
* Overall, I made it to the onsite for 8 companies
* On average, I had roughly 4 rounds of inter views per company
   * 1-2 rounds were pure LeetCode, generally medium / hard questions
   * 1 round System Design
   * 1 behavioural round, with deep dives into my past work experience and real world working knowledge
   * Occasionally also had an OOP round
* I made it to the last round with 3 companies, but was unfortunately not chosen every single time
* I am still currently looking for a job

My friends experience as an Accountant 

* Prepped behavioural questions using the STAR format about his work experience
* Applied to 8 different companies
* Heard back from all 8
* His inter views were all 1 round each, with an initial recruiter screening first just to go over his resume and career goals / why you want to join this company
* His on-site inter views were generally 1 to 1.5 hours long, where he was asked common behavioural questions (tell me your strengths, weaknesses, etc) and just talk about his past work experience
* He had offers from 6 of them, and accepted the highest paying one ($130k)

  
Overall, I'm just mind blown by the complete and utter lack of prep that my friend had to do. Like... it's just astonishing to me. He barely even had to search for a job to get one.

1mqzjgz,Recruiter mocked my unemployment and financial situation. How would you have handled this?,"A few months ago I went through final round interviews and received a written offer with a deadline. But before that, the recruiter called me unexpectedly and pushed hard for a comp number.

The call included:
* “You’re unemployed? What do you even do with your day?”
* “You live in ____? I know it’s expensive there, and you’ve been unemployed for a while. You must be financially struggling.”
* “Most companies wouldn’t even consider someone who’s been unemployed this long. You’re lucky we took a chance on you.”
* “What, you won’t give a number first? Do you not know how to read a job description?” (The JD did not specify equity or bonus)

I stayed calm and didn’t give a number. After the call, I requested to move communication to email.
He sent the offer. I responded with a standard counter (not aggressive). No reply for several days. I followed up and he gave dodgy non-answers, and pressed for more phone calls.

**A few days later, the offer was silently rescinded.** No warning, no explanation. Still within the confirmed signing window.

I’ve worked with assertive recruiters before. This wasn’t that. This was coercion followed by silent retaliation.

How would you have handled this? A few months ago I went through final round interviews and received a written offer with a deadline. But before that, the recruiter called me unexpectedly and pushed hard for a comp number.

The call included:
* “You’re unemployed? What do you even do with your day?”
* “You live in ____? I know it’s expensive there, and you’ve been unemployed for a while. You must be financially struggling.”
* “Most companies wouldn’t even consider someone who’s been unemployed this long. You’re lucky we took a chance on you.”
* “What, you won’t give a number first? Do you not know how to read a job description?” (The JD did not specify equity or bonus)

I stayed calm and didn’t give a number. After the call, I requested to move communication to email.
He sent the offer. I responded with a standard counter (not aggressive). No reply for several days. I followed up and he gave dodgy non-answers, and pressed for more phone calls.

**A few days later, the offer was silently rescinded.** No warning, no explanation. Still within the confirmed signing window.

I’ve worked with assertive recruiters before. This wasn’t that. This was coercion followed by silent retaliation.

1jjva6s,My company is starting to ask Leet Code hards and it's getting ridiculous.,"Ok, not gonna lie.. I’ve been feeling really frustrated lately, and I need to get this off my chest. As an interviewer at my company, I’ve always tried to keep things fair and focused on the actual work we do. But recently, that’s all changed.

We’re a mid-tier company...not a big tech giant, but we’ve been seeing a huge influx of candidates. I understand we want to bring in top talent, but the way we’re doing it now feels wrong.

Engineering Leadership has started pushing us to ask LeetCode hard problems. They literally told us ""stuff with less than a 30% acceptance rate, and make sure it's not from a popular list"". I wish I was joking. These problems don’t reflect the work we actually do here, but we’re being told to make them part of the interview process.

I’m now expected to throw candidates into these complex problems with tight time limits (usually 30-35 minutes after initial discussions / small talk). There’s no time to really discuss their thought process, no room for collaboration, and no way to test the skills that actually matter for the role. It feels like the focus is all on whether they can solve these stupid ass hard problems rather than seeing if they can actually do the job.

What’s really frustrating is that these interviews are filtering out good candidates. I’ve had candidates struggle through these algorithm problems, even though they would have been great fits for the role. But because they couldn’t get the solution to a random problem, we move on. It doesn’t matter if they have the right experience or the right mindset to be successful here.

It feels like we’re no longer hiring for skills, but for the ability to solve tough, abstract problems under pressure. I’ve been interviewing for a while now, and I just don’t understand why we’re focusing so much on something that has nothing to do with the work people will actually be doing.

The work we do here is practical. We deal with real systems, production code, and problems that require collaboration and tradeoffs. We don’t solve these kinds of algorithmic puzzles on the job. So why are we putting so much weight on these questions?

I get it...companies want to stand out and find the best talent. But I’m starting to feel like we’re pushing away qualified candidates because they can’t solve these random problems. I’ve seen people bomb these LeetCode questions and walk away feeling defeated, even though they would’ve been great at the actual job.

Is this the direction we’re headed in as an industry? Are we going to keep turning interviews into these algorithmic challenges that don’t even relate to the work? I’m starting to wonder if we’re losing sight of what actually matters.

Has anyone else been in this position where you’re asked to make interviews harder, even though it’s not helping find the right candidates? How do you handle it when the questions don’t match what’s actually needed for the job?

Then, spend 4 hours doing something that just gives you positive feelings about today: meditating, exercising, hanging out with a friend, watching a movie, finishing a few levels in a video game, whatever is your jam.  In 3 months, you  want to remember today as positive.

If you do that, n 3 months, whether you get a job or not, you will look back on today and (1) you tried to fix your problem, (2) you got some lasting value out of it and (3) there were some positive vibes.  You won't regret today.

1gno4vk,I'm planning to trash my Software Development career after 7 years. Here's why:,"After 7 bumpy years in software development, I've had enough. It's such a soul sucking stressful job with no end in sight. The grinding, the hours behind the screen, the constant pressure to deliver. Its just too much. I'm not quitting now but I've put a plan to move away from software here's why:

1- **Average Pay:** Unfortunatly the pay was not worth all the stress that you have to go through, It's not a job where you finish at 5 and clock out. Most of the time I had to work weekends and after work hours to deliver tasks

2- **The change of pace in technology**: My GOD this is so annoying every year, they come up with newer stuff that you have to learn and relearn and you see those requirements added to job descriptions. One minute its digital transformation, the other is crypto now Its AI. Give me a break

3- **The local competition**: Its so competitive locally, If you want to work in a good company in a country no matter where you are, you will always be faced with fierce competition and extensive coding assignements that are for the most part BS

4-  **Offshoring:** This one is so bad. Offshoring ruined it for me good, cause jobs are exported to cheaper countries and your chances for better salary are slim cause businesses will find ways to curb this expense.

5- **Age:** As you age, 35-50 yo: I can't imagine myself still coding while fresher graduates will be literally doing almost the same work as me. I know I should be doing management at that point. So It's not a long term career where you flourish, this career gets deprecated reallly quickly as you age.

6- **Legacy Code:** I hate working in Legacy code and every company I've worked with I had to drown in sorrows because of it.

7- **Technical Interviews:** Everytime i have to review boring technical questions like OOP, solid principles, system design, algorithms to eventually work on the company's legacy code. smh.

I can yap and yap how a career in software development is short lived and soul crushing. So I made the executive descision to go back to school to get my degree in management, and take on a management role. I'm craving some kind of stability where as I age I'm confident that my skills will still be relevant and not deprecated, even if that means I won't be paid much.

The problem is that I want to live my life, I don't want to spend it working my ass off, trying to fight of competition, technical debt, skill depreciation, devalution etc... I just want a dumb job where I do the work and go back home sit on my ass and watch some series...

1lvanv5,PSA from my recent loops- be careful with AI.,"I interview people sometimes.  My last 3 interview loops were all for junior engineers, and all did poorly for the same reason.  They had okay answers to initial questions, but none could speak at any depth in follow up questions.

So let’s say I’m interviewing you.  I can see you reading your responses off a screen, and you know what… that’s fine.  You maybe had some canned answers ready.

I ask you follow up questions and you need a minute to think, that’s great.  Take your time.  I can even pretend not to notice you obviously typing something while you “think”, maybe you are taking notes.

But if I ask you about your experiences, or why you wrote what you did or said what you did, you *must* be able to answer that question.  If I ask you why you used a loop there, you need to be able to explain your choice.  If I ask you how you solved that bug you are bragging about, you have to be able to walk me through it.

In short: I’m happy to pretend like you aren’t using an AI assist in your interviews if you can keep up the illusion.   But people who have actual skills and experiences can go from pleasant high-level summaries down several layers into explaining the details of what they understand.  Solving a difficult bug leaves a mark on your soul you don’t forget the details.  If I get a word salad of tech jargon as an answer, and every follow up question is a new word salad of jargon, i can’t hire you, because you give me nothing to work with.

I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if you want to interview successfully you need to be able to speak coherently like a human about your own choices.

1m62df3,[Rant] Rejected in 15 minutes by CEO after 4 rounds and days of work,"Totally frustrated and needed to let this out.

I am a new grad, Dec 2024, with some years of work experience. I have been applying like crazy and finally got an interview with a company, and I thought that “Finally, I might land this job as I cleared 4 rounds”. But bro, this one totally broke me.

Here’s how it went:

1. **HR call** – pretty standard.
2. **Online assessment** – did well - JavaScript, node.js, SQL questions and 2 LeetCode questions
3. **Home Assignment** – spent DAYS on this. I built a full-stack review dashboard for customer reviews approval by manager and integrated it with their main website to match the UI/UX (not their production app, just matched exact same UI and CSS and made a separate page to show it working).. Added other features also. Discussed it in-depth with the CTO (1-hour technical discussion).
4. **Follow-up Round** –  1-hour technical with the CTO. For this round, he asked me to implement OpenAI API for text analysis of reviews and auto-suggestions based on customer feedback. I thought it went well as he was happy with my work and told me to prepare for next round.
5. **Final Boss The CEO Round** – I was asked a system design question (LLD) around 3rd-party APIs. I started explaining my thought process.... then he just abruptly ended it with a ""have a nice day"" after 15 minutes. No feedback. No explanation. Just gone.

No idea what went wrong. After the interview, I was sitting on my chair, totally numb and thinking that I just spent 20+ hours building a working AI tool for you and in just 15 minutes got a sweet rejection.

I am so much drained and frustrated. That home assignment alone took so many days. I researched and studied so many things for the assessment. Today, I feel burned out and feel like leaving the software industry. Don't know when this cycle of unemployment will end. 😭😭😭😫

Anyway, just needed a place to vent this out.

1jtz4sq,"The bar is absolutely, insanely high.","Interviewed at a unicorn tech company for internship, and made it to the final round. I felt I did incredibly well in the OA, behavioral, and technical interview rounds. For my final technical round, I was asked an OOP question, and I finished the implementation within 40-45 minutes. The process was a treadmill style problem, so once I got done with the implementation, I was asked a few follow up questions and was asked to implement the functionalities.

I felt that I communicated my thought process well and asked plenty of clarifying questions. I was very confident I got the internship.

1in0xo5,"Junior developers, make sure you aren't making the mistake of being passive","Online and at my own places of work I've seen a number of junior developers balk at their poor performance reviews or who are blindsided by a layoff. Because of legal repercussions, a lot of companies today avoid mentioning when the reason for the layoff is performance-related. So I thought I'd give you the reason you were likely laid off or got a shitty performance review as a junior.

There are two types of juniors; those who come in burning to contribute and those who come in and passively accept the work that is given to them. The second type will sort of disappear if nothing is assigned to them. They don't assertively see what needs doing, they just wait for a task, finish it slowly and disappear until they're given another task. Or even worse, they don't even know how to start the task, but don't ask. Then 4 days later in standup the team finds out the junior hasn't even started the task because they're at a standstill with a question they're too afraid to ask.  
  
This will not go well for you. Just because you ""do everything assigned to you"" doesn't mean it's enough. If there are long gaps between your tasks where you have nothing to do, trust me, your team notices. If it takes you days to ask a question, they notice. They might not say anything, but they notice. If you're an absolutely brilliant senior who crushes it in design and architecture but are crappy at getting actual tasks done, that's one thing. That's okay. But a junior doesn't have those brownie points.  
  
I've worked with around 4-5 of these juniors over my career across different companies and they were always stunned when they were laid off. One guy was laid off right before Christmas and I had the misfortune of overhearing it. I liked him personally, he was funny, but he did next to nothing all year. The people who laid him off made absolutely no mention of his performance, and when he asked if they were sure, they reassured him that performance nothing to do with it. It was an ""economic decision."" This was a total lie, because I knew of someone in leadership who was counting the days in between his status updates.

I'm not saying it's right or ethical if you're not informed when your performance is catching negative attention, but it is the truth. I personally don't even care if I work with a poor performing junior... if they're really bad, it's less work for me to just do it myself and let them disappear. I also believe in workers getting away what they can get away with. It's not my money.

But now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.

Despite the rush to integrate powerful new models, about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration; the vast majority stall, delivering little to no measurable impact on P&L. The research—based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments—paints a clear divide between success stories and stalled projects.

The reality of building web apps in 2025 is that it's a bit like assembling IKEA furniture. There's no ""full-stack"" product with batteries included, you have to piece together and configure many individual services:

- frontend / backend (e.g. React, Next.js, APIs)
- hosting (cdn, https, domains, autoscaling)
- database
- authentication (custom, social logins)
- blob storage (file uploads, urls, cdn-backed)
- email
- payments
- background jobs
- analytics
- monitoring
- dev tools (CI/CD, staging)
- secrets

I'm relatively new to modern web dev and find the above a bit overwhelming, e.g. I'm embarrassed to share it took me ~3 hours the other day to create and configure a supabase with a vercel app and resolve a few errors. The second you stray just slightly from the ""getting started"" tutorial in the docs you're suddenly in the wilderness. It's not even code, it's... configurations, plumbing, orchestration, workflows, best practices. A lot of glory will go to whoever figures out how to make it accessible and ""just work"" out of the box, for both humans and, increasingly and especially, AIs.

1jcmebc,Senior engineer's guide to first few weeks at a new job,"I’m (6yoe, senior MLE) starting a new job in the next month and I’m planning my first few weeks there. I’ve made a personal list of things I think I should do, based on my own observations, performance reviews, and opinions. I thought I’d share it with you and see what you think. **If you have more ideas/recommendations, do comment!**

Basically, I treat it like a video game: getting to know my surroundings, what each ""NPC"" does, how to level up, and what starting tools or items I have.

1. Get coffee with everyone you can. Absorb information. Don't be all business—socialize, especially in a small team. Have 1:1 meetings with as many people as possible. Find a work buddy who can vouch for you and possibly refer you later (potentially a tech buddy). Build relationships with co-workers who are happy to help.
2. Don't lie. Don't get drunk. Don't gossip.
3. Show effort: In tech, effort matters as much as results. Show willingness by occasionally staying an extra 30 minutes when needed and volunteering for tasks. Stay motivated and take initiative.
4. **Secure Early Wins, Show Results:** Get an early victory by completing a visible task exceptionally well. Prove yourself through your first few assignments. Be thorough and put in extra hours during your first month. Make your first contribution in week one—find something small and manageable, then excel at it. Remember: ""If you have a reputation for coming in early, you can be late every day."" Put in extra effort at the beginning to establish yourself as reliable. In a good workplace, this builds trust and flexibility. When tackling your first deliverable, go above and beyond—people will respect you and invest in your success.
5. **Effective Communication with Boss, 90 day plan**: Have five key conversations with your boss about situational diagnosis, expectations, communication styles, resource needs, and personal development. Use these to create your 90-day plan. Understand your manager's expectations for your first 30 to 90 days. Stay proactive, track your contributions, and maintain regular progress updates.
6. Keep weekly reports in Apple Notes. Take thorough notes about possibly everything.
7. Don't wait 5-7 months to show your potential, as commonly advised. Be brave, bold, and confident to get ahead. Don't fear being inventive, but avoid showing off or making immediate changes. Be polite to everyone. Combine the confidence of a mid-level employee with a junior's eagerness to learn.
8. Get up, dress up, and show up.



PS: This is not for karma farming. I’m not self-promoting or asking a question here. I made notes for myself based on my own experiences, and shared them, hoping they’d be useful to someone.

1l5apme,Got an offer from Meta - here are my tips,"Landed a job at Meta earlier this year (got lucky with timing before the Feb 10 layoffs lol).

**Job summary:**
```
Position: Mid-Level Software Engineer L4
TC: $350k (193 base, 29 bonus, 128 stock/year)
YOE: 2.5 years
```

**The interview process:**
* Phone screen: 2 leetcode problems in 45 mins
* Final: 2 leetcode rounds (same format as phone screen) + 1 behavioral round + 1 system design round
* Total Time: 5 hours

From initial contact to offer signing took 2 months.

**The framework that worked:**

With 2 problems in 45 minutes, you really only get 22 minutes per problem. Here is how I would break it down.

1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)** \- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.
2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)** \- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.
3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)** \- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.
4. **Wrap up (2 mins)** \- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.

**How I prepared:**

* Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.
* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.

I know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off! I was looking for a job for 9 months until I got this opportunity lmao. Ask me anything!

1mfteom,Hiring norms have changed much faster than entry level candidates realize,"A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.

(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)

Let me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may ""know"" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.

Number one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?

Number two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.

Third most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they ""get it""? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.

None of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.

Here are a few common examples:

* Sending very flowery, ""fake personalized"", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.
* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.
* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to ""stand out"" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.**
* Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**

What these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**

1gstu6s,The Tech Job Recession,"I've been through four “tech job recessions” in my career since the 90s. I've seen lots of angst in reddit posts about the current one.

TLDR: Understanding financial statements will help you navigate the tech job market.

From my experience, companies with [YOY real earnings (RE) growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-earnings-growth/table/by-year) \> a risk free premium (around 8%) can afford  more staff. Until they realize YOY growth, they will:

* lean heavily on reduced staff so the labor pool will have more supply than demand, and
* increase scrutiny of recruit actions for high cost labor, especially roles with both salary and RSU components.

The 4 tech job recessions I’ve experienced triggered by negative YOY RE growth:

1. 1991 Cold War peace dividend: -27%.
2. 2001 Dotcom bust:-51%
3. 2008 Great recession:-77%
4. 2022 Post Covid market:-18%

If you want a “safe” job, your job must create Intellectual Property (IP) or a product that will sell. A corporate balance sheet will then treat your job as an asset to protect. 

* Cloud SW engineers have enjoyed 10-15 years as targets of investment for cloud services. Network, chip design, ERP, storage, mobile - every tech specialty has had their moment in the sun - but none of them have approached Cloud SW’s enviable run. 
* Current and future investment targets AI which relies on HW and storage to feed LLMs. NVDIA's growth illustrates this retro shift to HW as the source of future IP.
* The [US tax code](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-63.pdf) has treated SW less favorably since 2018. Companies can no longer immediately expense costs for software development. Instead, they must amortize software development over 5 years if done in the US, and over 15 years if done outside the US. Low interest loans and pandemic era PPP loans can no longer offset the loss of favorable tax treatment of SW expenses.

Little solace for those struggling, but past tech job market recessions have been worse. Hopefully earnings improve which would allow the job market to turn more positive soon.",1086,0.95,142,2024-11-16 21:40:09,EmptiSense,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1gstu6s/the_tech_job_recession/,True,0,False,False,21,Saturday,2024-11-16,2024-11,0.13063477460901565,134.9,"The Tech Job Recession I've been through four “tech job recessions” in my career since the 90s.

From my experience, companies with [YOY real earnings (RE) growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-earnings-growth/table/by-year) \> a risk free premium (around 8%) can afford  more staff. Until they realize YOY growth, they will:

* lean heavily on reduced staff so the labor pool will have more supply than demand, and
* increase scrutiny of recruit actions for high cost labor, especially roles with both salary and RSU components.

The 4 tech job recessions I’ve experienced triggered by negative YOY RE growth:

1. 1991 Cold War peace dividend: -27%.
2. 2001 Dotcom bust:-51%
3. 2008 Great recession:-77%
4. 2022 Post Covid market:-18%

If you want a “safe” job, your job must create Intellectual Property (IP) or a product that will sell. A corporate balance sheet will then treat your job as an asset to protect. 

* Cloud SW engineers have enjoyed 10-15 years as targets of investment for cloud services. Network, chip design, ERP, storage, mobile - every tech specialty has had their moment in the sun - but none of them have approached Cloud SW’s enviable run. 
* Current and future investment targets AI which relies on HW and storage to feed LLMs. NVDIA's growth illustrates this retro shift to HW as the source of future IP.
* The [US tax code](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-63.pdf) has treated SW less favorably since 2018. Companies can no longer immediately expense costs for software development. Instead, they must amortize software development over 5 years if done in the US, and over 15 years if done outside the US. Low interest loans and pandemic era PPP loans can no longer offset the loss of favorable tax treatment of SW expenses.

Little solace for those struggling, but past tech job market recessions have been worse. Hopefully earnings improve which would allow the job market to turn more positive soon.",22,2068,2091,0.079,0.772,0.149,0.9727,Positive,True,True,True

1ggp3hy,"You study for 12-16 hours a day for 6-12 months and finally land a job, only for you to get placed on a PIP, laid off, or fired in about a year. This career is so broken beyond belief.","*""Any job that requires you to study for 6 months just to have a chance of getting through the interview is not worth it.""*

I heard the above quote a while back, but I cannot find the source. The ""you"" in it refers to an individual who has the credentials and experience, and can demonstrate that they can code. The absurd thing is that these type of individuals still need to study for months to crack an interview.

During the course of my unemployment, one thing that I keep hearing from those around me is that I should keep applying, but I should also enjoy my newfound free time. Most of the people telling me this are in the health care field, mainly nurses, and that's when it hit me, the difference between this career and virtually all other careers. I have no free time, none at all. I'm not making any money currently, but all my time is occupied, I am working more than I would be even if I was in a job. What am I doing? I'm studying or ""grinding"" as those in this career refer to it as. However, when virtually any other career-possessing individual is on the job hunt, they are able to just apply and go on with their life in the meantime. I keep getting asked ""what and why are you studying?""

Yes, I can always pick up a low-wage job, fast food or the like, and none of that is beneath me, I have a mortgage and I will do whatever I can to ensure that my home is not seized, and people in other careers often can do that as well, but in the software engineering job hunt, doing that is a detriment to finding another software engineering position, because it severely limits the amount of hours you can put into studying algorithms, leetcode, system design, frameworks, or the like. All of my friends and family are in the health care field, and with overtime and holiday pay they made far more than I ever did, and they never had to open any nursing book again after graduating from their respective nursing programs, and their interviews were all one a done, a couple minutes just to see your personality. And if they ever want to switch jobs, they can do so or even pick up a second one in a matter of days, no preparation needed.

When I think about how the average Google employee quits in about a year, the idea of spending 6 months studying full-time just to have a chance of passing the interview (which you still might fail) seems all the more insane.

Although I do not regret studying computer science, I admit that becoming a software engineer was the wrong choice, but hindsight is 2020.",1081,0.79,656,2024-11-01 00:06:45,CHARispronouncedCARE,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ggp3hy/you_study_for_1216_hours_a_day_for_612_months_and/,True,0,False,False,0,Friday,2024-11-01,2024-11,0.6062846580406654,518.24,"You study for 12-16 hours a day for 6-12 months and finally land a job, only for you to get placed on a PIP, laid off, or fired in about a year.

1kc3wz7,Tips from an average dev with an above average pay,"Whenever I read posts here, I get scared. I have the impression that I’m about to be fired and that finding a good job will be impossible. I don’t know if I’m super lucky but… CS has been a good and easy field for me.

I have graduated from an average european engineering school. Did a three year apprenticeship in an average company. Moved to Switzerland and tripled my salary. A couple years later changed company and I’m almost at 160k fixed salary.

All that and… I’m not a super good developer. Honestly, compared to my peers I would say I’m slightly (very slightly) above average. I never did leetcode. I havent read a CS book in the last 10 years. I don’t keep up with new technologies (I’m a Java dev and I dont know what’s the latest version).

But hey, looking back on my career, I do think I have a few positive points that made me get here :

- I have more social skills than 90% of my dev colleagues. Yes this in an stereotype. Some of the best developers I met are completely autistic. These guys can’t hold a normal conversation for 5 minutes. Let alone when there’s a woman in the conv

- Learn languages. I’m one of the only ones on my team who can write in english correctly and speak without a heavy accent. I have been put in so many meetings just because I spoke english. Languages really open doors.

- I never refused work. Whenever my boss asks me to do some menial, non-interesting, boring task… I just do it. When someone needs to do it, I volunteer for it. Really, it’s that simple, even if the task is dumb

- When someone asks you do somethint, always ask for a ticket or an email. You’re not a decision taker, you’re a developer. This will get you out of trouble.

- Be friends with people from other  : have a DBA friend, have a DevOps friend, have a Sec engineer friend. You’ll need them. 

That’s it guys. It’s plain, simple and everyone can do it but most people won’t do it

1i0c8j1,7 questions you will get asked ,"I've lost count of how many interviews I've done throughout my career. But I realized in most interviews they asked the same questions. I thought I'd share to help anyone just starting their career.

1. First is always **""Tell me about yourself""** Keep it to work related stuff only, little or no personal life. 2 minutes max.
2. **""Why do you want this job?""** Research the company before your interview and mention specific things they do that match your skills. Don't give generic answers like ""seems like a great company"" they never work.
3. **""How do you handle (xyz situation) e.g stress?""** Don't just say something like ""I'm organized."" Tell them about a real situation you handled and how you managed to do it.
4. **""What are your strengths and weaknesses?""** Have a real weakness ready but make it something you're working on fixing.
5. **""Tell me about a time you had conflict at work""** Focus on how you solved it professionally, they're not interested in the problem but more about how you handled it.
6. **Salary questions.** For the salary question, look up the normal pay ranges for your job type in your area before the interview.
7. **""Where do you see yourself in five years?""** Link your answer to growth within their company.

Quick tips:

* Make it more about your professional life less about your personal life
* Have real work examples ready for when they ask about how you handle xyz situation
* Never talk trash about your old job
* Research the company you're applying for!
* Always use real numbers and stats when you can

i asked HR to notify security of this ongoing harassment, for which they replied stating that they had. i found out that HR lied about this, after asking security if they knew about what was going on, they looked genuinely confused and didn’t know what was going on. not even the building manager was aware of the situation until today.

the worst part about this is that he never got fired. i feel powerless, the fact that i have to see him everyday at work is genuinely painful and taking a toll on my mental health. at least i have a police report filed against him for second degree harassment. 

also, after HR found out that I filed the police report, HR came down as damage control, telling me to go back to the office, on the floor where my harasser sits, and talk to leadership. not really sure what their intentions were. On top of this, i received an email the next day instructing me to work remotely and that i wasn't allowed to come to their 10-year anniversary party.  

EDIT: my macbook, slack, and email have all been locked out. now, i don’t have access to anything, or anyone from work.

1iu3204,Hacking the Linked In Algo (Tricks To Get Recruiters To Message YOU),"Helping people get jobs and building cool stuff is what im passionate about so im back with another guide. This time talking about how to optimize your linkedIn to get inbound.

As always before you read, here are some screenshots of the results you’ll get by following this guide.

[https://imgur.com/a/j1SQ7Cl](https://imgur.com/a/j1SQ7Cl)

\*this account has been inactive for a while and still gets lots of inbound

  
If you have a decent amount of experience ( greater than 3 years) linked in can be a really powerful tool for getting eyes on your resume and many recruiters use it as their preferred method of contact (because linkedIn vets harder for fake candidates than other job sites)

The way this method works is by taking advantage of recruiter search. In other guides i've talked about LinkedIn Sales Navigator. This is the search dashboard that recruiters use to find candidates for roles.

If we can make good guesses about what the recruiter is searching for to fill roles we can make our linkedIN profile show up as the first result in every search query they make.

No one else is using linkedIn this way, so optimizing your profile to rank highly in sales navigator can really take your job search to the next level.

In this guide im going to show you what recruiters are searching for, how to optimize your profile and some tricks to make things work better along the way (edited)

Before we start with the linked in profile, it's important to know what recruiters are searching by. Here are the filter options they have on their end:

[https://imgur.com/a/XWT2PIQ](https://imgur.com/a/XWT2PIQ)

**your goal with linkedin should be to always remain in these filters for their searches**

after finding your profile they can pull your resume if you have it set to public and your phone # / email or they can send you a linkedin inbound message about the job they have.

**The most important filter they use is your Job title & Headline** 

Use the most common / transferable job title to describe your position, even when your official title is different. Avoid over-complicated or long titles.

If your title is too generic, you can add a specialization or vertical.

Example: “Account Manager, Luxury” or “Software Engineer, Machine Learning”.your goal with your title like everything else is to catch as many searches as possible

**The next most important section is skills**

Skills are typically used to narrow searches to specialties. They include core functional skills

(“Business Development”, “Project Management”), languages, softwares & programming

languages (“Python”, “Illustrator”), or soft skills (“Communication”, “Problem Solving”). My advice is to add all skills that match your background. **Do not forget to add your languages, even if you only speak English** (you could be excluded from searches that use a must speak english Filter if not)

**Next section: Years of graduation**

sorting by this is a trick recruiters use to figure out your approximate age & seniority. Even if you haven’t completed a degree, listing-up an educational background keeps you in play when years of graduation is a filter in their search. If you don't have years of graduation filled in here, you will be excluded from every search that includes it

**Industry**

your industry is not displayed on your public profile, it is still a very commonly used criteria. You can either choose an Industry (“Consumer Goods”) or a function (“Accounting”), based on what makes most sense for a recruiter to find you 

If you're trying to break into tech change your current industry to whichever tech you're trying to break intoHeres a full list of all your options since the linkedIn UI only lets you search instead of browse.

\[linked removed, just search google for the list\]

Once you've done the above you can start getting inbound by putting yourself on the ""hot"" list

When displaying search results, LinkedIN Recruiters shows profiles that are more likely to reply on a different list. These are the people who will be contacted first by the recruiter!

  
here's how the hot list looks on their end: [https://imgur.com/a/Iych0w8](https://imgur.com/a/Iych0w8)

 \* You want to be in the More Likely To Respond or Open To New Opportunities Group

**Background / Profile Picture** 

Neither of these are a must, but I do recommend as they do help. For profile pictures obviously use a professional headshot. If you have one of you speaking in public that is also really good for the background. If not use something related to your field such as computers etc. Profile Summary Your profile summary should be an elevator pitch here is an example for Data analyst

>

**Finally your jobs section**

A LinkedIN profile is not a resume. It should allow recruiters what your strongest technologies and job titles are. Don't list out all of your accomplishments or a bunch of percentages etc. Example: Developed various software solutions for a game development company

using **Python**, **Spark**, **SQL**, **Pandas**, and **Looker**; this included deploying a

logistic regression model to boost in-app purchases and improving user

experience through a **Bayesian** inference-based multi-arm bandit strategy.

Go through and fill all this out for all your jobs, make sure you're **set to open to work,** your skills section contains every technology and keyword you can think of and then **set your resume to searchable by recruiters.** You will have 2-3 linkedin inbound messages a day and a few calls from linkedin recruiters

The final tip I have for you is to update your linkedIn Profile once per week. Recruiters and linkedIn can see when it was last updated. If your profile was updated recently recruiters see this as more likely to respond and you will get more messages.

**This is without any outbound.** If you combine this with my post on automating LinkedIn outbound you will get crazy results[ like this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSCareerHacking/comments/1h7m3sb/what_an_seo_optimized_linked_in_account_looks_like/)

1hwolfg,You'll Never Be The Perfect Applicant,"**Three fun facts about me:**

1. Ive been a professional developer for 10+ years
2. I've worked at 5 different companies (ranging from 10-person start ups to FAANG)
3. I've never been ""qualified"" for a job I was hired for

**What Do I Mean?**  
I’m not saying I tricked anyone into hiring me. Rather, if I look back at each job posting’s “requirements” versus my skills at the time, I was never a perfect match.

I currently run a website and weekly newsletter to help programmers build their tech careers. One of the biggest issues I see is people **rejecting themselves** before they even apply for a job. They’ll see postings that list:

* 3 years experience
* Experience with random\_react\_Library\_1
* Experience with random\_react\_Library\_2

They’ll think: “Well, I only have 1.5 years of experience and I only know library #1. Guess I’m out.” And they don’t apply.

**How Job Postings Really Work**  
A job listing usually describes the *perfect* candidate—someone with the right number of years, the exact tools, the ideal background. **In reality, that perfect candidate rarely applies, or may not even exist.** Companies often hire someone who has a good chunk of the requirements and shows a willingness to learn the rest.

Instead of rejecting yourself on the company’s behalf, submit your application. Let them decide if you’re missing something critical.

**A few caveats:**

**1. Be Realistic**  
I’m not saying to go wild and apply for senior machine learning roles if you’re a junior frontend dev. If a company is looking for a web developer and you match about 50–70% of the posting, go for it. That’s a realistic gamble worth taking.

**2. Become More of The Candidate They Want**  
You might match 60% of the requirements for a job and land an interview a week later. That’s a solid heads-up: you’ve got a description of their “perfect candidate.” Spend the days before your interview filling gaps in your knowledge. You don’t need to become an expert in Flask or Retrofit overnight, but at least learn the basics.

If they ask, “Have you used Flask before?” consider these two answers:

**Answer A:** “No, I’ve never used it.”  
**Answer B:** “No, I haven’t used it in a project yet, but I understand it’s a popular Python library for building APIs. My experience so far has been with pre-built APIs, but I’ve been excited to learn Flask.”

Which do you think sounds better?

**3. Find Commonalities in Listings**  
While you’re applying, pay attention to recurring skills you lack. If you see “Jetpack Compose” in 9 out of 10 Android job postings, that’s a hint. Spend your downtime learning Jetpack Compose. Job searching can take a long time, so use that time to keep improving your chances as a candidate.

**Conclusion**  
I hope this post helps. I originally began writing it for my dev newsletter, but I realized it might benefit the broader community. If you’ve been holding back on applying for jobs because you’re not a 100% match, go for it anyway. Let the company decide if you’re a fit—you might be surprised by the outcome.

And best of luck on your job search!

1gjyocv,The real reason that AI won't replace software developers (that nobody mentions).,"Why is AI attractive? Because it promises to give higher output for less input. Why won't this work the way that everyone expects? Be because software is complicated.

More specifically, there is a particular reason *why* software is complicated. 

Natural language contains context, which means that one sentence can mean multiple different things, depending on tone, phrasing, etc. Ex: ""Go help your uncle Jack *o*ff the horse"".

Programming languages, on the other hand, are context-*free.* Every bit on each assembly instruction has a specific meaning. Each variable, function, or class is defined explicitly. There is no interpretation of meaning and no contextual gaps.

If a dev uses an LLM to convert natural language (containing context) into context-free code, it will need to fill in contextual gaps to do this. 

For each piece of code written this way, the dev will need to either clarify and explicitly define the context intended for that code, or assume that it isn't important and go with the LLM's assumption.

Why is AI attractive? Because it promises to give higher output for less input. Why won't this work the way that everyone expects? Be because software is complicated.

More specifically, there is a particular reason *why* software is complicated. 

Natural language contains context, which means that one sentence can mean multiple different things, depending on tone, phrasing, etc. Ex: ""Go help your uncle Jack *o*ff the horse"".

Programming languages, on the other hand, are context-*free.* Every bit on each assembly instruction has a specific meaning. Each variable, function, or class is defined explicitly. There is no interpretation of meaning and no contextual gaps.

If a dev uses an LLM to convert natural language (containing context) into context-free code, it will need to fill in contextual gaps to do this. 

For each piece of code written this way, the dev will need to either clarify and explicitly define the context intended for that code, or assume that it isn't important and go with the LLM's assumption.

At this point, they might as well be just writing the code. If you are using specific, context-free English (or Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, etc) to prompt an LLM, why not just write the same thing in context-free code?

1l91bzv,The best advice on how to get a job in this market,"95% of this subreddit is people complaining about the job market or AI.  The remaining 5% of actual advice is straight up garbage and completely outdated.  Thought I would help out by making a list of things that will greatly improve your job search

As a background, I have 6 years of Software Engineering experience and have worked with people of many backgrounds.  I have never worked at FAANG, went to a mediocre school with mediocre grades, never had an internships or anything like that.  But I have also never been unemployed.  This isn't for the .1% of people, this is for the common CS man (or woman).  And if you were asking, I'm a U.S. citizen in the U.S. market.  If you are neither of those this probably won't apply to you.

With that out of the way here's what I have gathered from my experience:

**1. Apply to local/hybrid jobs in non-tech hubs.**  
Your goal is to reduce competition as much as possible.  When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio.  You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist.  A lot of them have barely any applicants.  If they are desperate enough they will hire you.  Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away

**2. Make sure your resume is concise.**  
When I review resumes I hate ones that have tons of wordy bullet points that basically say nothing.  Don't dilute your resume with crap.  Most people have 1-2 important projects they have worked on at a company and a bunch of filler work.  Just focus on the important stuff and make sure it is clear what you actually did.  Also PLEASE do not use arbitrary percentages in your bullet points.  I hate this advice so much just put what you actually worked on.  It doesn't matter how the business benefitted we all know that is the point of work.

**3. Similar to 2, make sure your technical skills are concise**  
If you put every tool or technology it looks like you have very little experience in lots of things.  Focus on putting skills that are needed for the job you are applying to.  Another easy approach is to take the skills you are best at (say React), and filter only for jobs with React.  Then do the same thing with Angular etc.

**4. If you don't have any experience (or limited) YOU NEED TO DO PROJECTS**  
You need some way to show that you have some sort of technical knowledge or drive.  You don't need a github, but you should have projects that you can explain how they work.  This is especially crucial for internships.  My company just hired an intern that was the CEO/Cofounder of a startup.  Her startup? Building websites with other students for various people.  Sounds stupid, but it got her an internship.

**5. Just straight up fucking lie**  
I don't want to endorse this, but I just want people to know who they are competing with when they send out 500 applications without a response.  We hired someone who had experience as a software engineer.  But they accidentally told me they were a QA at their last role.  I checked their linked in and they were listed as a software engineer.  So yeah, if you work in tech support, QA, product.  Doesn't matter, you were a software engineer

**6.  Same as number 5**  
This is more reasonable in my opinion because recruiters are stupid.  If you have React experience and applying to a job with Angular, congrats - you actually have Angular experience.  Same with Java and C# etc.  The important thing is you are able to actually pass an interview for this stuff.  It is worth it to review core concepts and maybe do a few leetcode problems in that language.  At the end of the day you need a job

**7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest**  
When I was interviewing for a job I wanted they asked me a common interview question about a time I failed.  So I told them a real story about how I messed up getting requirements and caused a delay in the release.  I didn't get this job.  The next job I applied to asked the same question, so I told the same story but rephrased it where product threw a bunch of requirements at me last minute and I had to work overtime to get things across the finish line.  I did get this job.  You get the idea

**8. Do not negotiate**  
There's a lot of people on this sub that will scold you for not negotiating.  But I have seen first hand peoples' offers get rescinded for negotiating, especially in this market.  Just accept the damn offer once you get to this stage.  Every job I've gotten when I negotiate I got $5k more on top of the initial offer which is not worth risking losing an offer over.  I simply asked if there was any wiggle room and they gave me basically the same offer

**9: For students: do not waste your time**  
Seriously, start applying/working on projects as early as you can.  Grades hardly matter.  I knew a dumb kid that had a 4.0.  It didn't make a difference when it came to getting a job.  He could have spent some of his time studying instead building a react app or something and gotten a 3.7 and been better off.  Take as many easy classes as possible and focus on learning on your own time.  Most CS classes I've taken taught be .01% of my current CS knowledge

**10: Make sure everything is up to date, even when employed**  
Keep your resume up to date with your latest experience.  Try to check LinkedIn/Indeed once a week or so.  I've seens job boards get flooded with really good jobs one week, which all get removed the next.  You never know when that next opportunity is going to be available so it's good to always be looking.",872,0.93,266,2025-06-11 22:11:29,nysoxfan01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l91bzv/the_best_advice_on_how_to_get_a_job_in_this_market/,True,0,False,False,22,Wednesday,2025-06-11,2025-06,0.30469644902634596,247.38000000000002,"The best advice on how to get a job in this market 95% of this subreddit is people complaining about the job market or AI.

I asked this question because in my experience contractors haven't tended to do the best long term job (about 20% are alright or top-notch).  I've been the janitor and person gluing (crappy) things together too much and was looking for a firm that prioritized in-house development.  I did not get the offer.

> Panel: ""Why are you asking this question?  A lot of our code is written by external contractors.""

I asked this question because in my experience contractors haven't tended to do the best long term job (about 20% are alright or top-notch).  I've been the janitor and person gluing (crappy) things together too much and was looking for a firm that prioritized in-house development.  I did not get the offer.

A month later I found a much better position (and higher pay) so in general I'm happy.  But I'm still bewildered by response to my question.",67,1159,1227,0.048,0.846,0.107,0.9194,Positive,True,True,True

1j81if5,My colleague has contributed nothing for 2 years and hasn't been fired,"*Originally posted on r/ExperiencedDevs but got removed by mods because it's a rant (to be fair, it is). Hopefully this kind of content is allowed here.*

I'm a mid level software engineer (3 YoE) at a medium sized software company. We mostly WFH.

There's this junior engineer on my team (let's call him Slacker) who does no work at all, EVER. Slacker has worked at the company for over 2 years, and it's his first job. At this point I'm certain that Slacker has had a negative overall contribution to the company by wasting other people's time.

Slacker is super creative when it comes to excuses. Every single day there is a new excuse.

The engineering department does a daily end of day call where each person gives a brief update saying what they did that day. I usually zone out when most other people give their updates because the meeting is mostly for the benefit of the department head. However, I always listen to Slacker's update purely for my own amusement.

It's worth noting that the end of day call is completely optional, yet Slacker still makes a point of attending every day to let us all know that he got nothing done and what the reason was. Usually the reason will be some minor inconvenience, but he ends up spinning it as a big thing that prevented him from getting any work done for the entire day. When talking, 90% of his update is about the excuse and 10% of the update is about the work he was meant to be doing.

Some recent examples:

* He had a head ache
* He was feeling run down
* He was feeling fuzzy
* He was feeling tired
* Someone was over to remove a wasp nest outside his house
* An engineer came over to look at his boiler
* His boss had slow WiFi
* He had a flat inspection coming up so needed to tidy
* He had a doctor's appointment 
* He needed to inspect a flat (he used this excuse about once per week for 6 months until he finally moved)
* He needed to deal with some personal stuff (with no further elaboration)
* He used eye drops and couldn't see

Occasionally, in the end of day call, Slacker will report that he got some work done. However, if you ever dig into what he actually did, or worked with him that day and know the truth about what happened, it's always less than 20 minutes of actual work.

A recent example: the other day Slacker updated his PDP objectives on the work HR system, which is a simple copy and paste task based on predefined objectives our boss gave us. It should take 5 minutes. For Slacker, this was the only thing he did that day. And the next day he had the audacity to announce in the morning call that his plan for that day was finish off his goals. How had he not already finished them?!

I sometimes wonder what Slacker actually does all day. Although we work from home 99% of the time, there have been a few times that we were both working in the office. Every time I walked past his desk he was on his phone scrolling through Twitter. 

One time my boss was on holiday for a week and asked me to stand in for him as deputy. During this week, Slacker was offline most days, missing most of his calls, and ignored me when I offered to help him out. When my boss returned, I said my piece about Slacker's performance. My boss admitted that Slacker gets assigned the easiest ""quick win"" tickets, and he can't even get those done. These tickets would drag on for weeks. Slacker's tickets only get done if our boss or someone else in the team manages to get Slacker in a call and walks him through how to solve the problem and what code to type - basically doing the work for him. When Slacker does occasionally raise a PR, the code changes were always written this way either by our boss, me or other colleagues. 

It's not that Slacker isn't supported. Our boss is super supportive, but Slacker delays or actively avoids help, probably because receiving help would mean that he has to do some actual work.

I have no idea how Slacker has not been fired. The company is clearly all about profit, but this guy is getting paid around £35k a year to drag other people down whilst bringing nothing to the table himself. Honestly, at this point I wouldn't be surprised if 2 years from now he's still employed here.

Edit: To address the many comments about Slacker being underpaid: this may be hard to understand, but £35k is an above average salary for an entry level software engineer role in my city. I'm not going to share a source for that as I don't want to reveal the city, so you'll have to take me on my word.

1jipn40,"AI is replacing juniors, so companies only hires seniors. If everyone is senior then what?","My startup is a perfect example of this. Mature, growth stage startup pulling in $250mm ARR. 

We have an eng org of ~300, and there’s less than a dozen junior engineers. I’m not even sure if we have mid level engineers. What we have are teams that look like this:

- EM
- PM
- Designer
- Senior 1
- Senior 2
- Senior 3
- Senior 4
- Staff 1

- Senior Staff/Lead

So the senior roles are literally and simultaneously both the bottom of the totem pole and a terminal career stage. 

Why no juniors? AFAIK we haven’t hired a junior in 3 years. My guess is that AI is making seniors more efficient so they’d rather just keep hiring seniors and make them use copilot instead of handholding juniors.  

AND YET, our career leveling rubric still has “mentorship” and “teaching juniors” for leveling up to staff - what fucking juniors are there to speak of??

Meanwhile Staff is more of a zero sum game - there’s only a set number of Staff positions in the company. But all the senior want to get promoted to Staff to make more money, and keep getting promo denied. 

It’s all a fucking farce now. Can we just stop bullshitting and just agree that Staff is the new Senior, and make promos more regular.

1g22jz4,The abysmal state of hiring for software engineer roles and some tips. ,"I have been at a position where I will do both the first “get to know you” interviews and technical interviews, for SE positions at my current company, and I need to rant about a few things I have noticed. 

1. Fake resumes: the amount of people who lie on their resumes is insane, not only about the technologies they used but also about their work experience and education. It makes it harder for real applicants to get noticed and it makes it harder for us to hire them…
2. Unable to answer basic questions: don’t say you have implemented technology X if you can’t tell me what the fuck you did with technology X. It’s fine if you don’t know the details of technology X, but tell me how you interacted with it. 
3. (This one is for the companies hiring) stop pushing candidates to be competitive code gamers like leetcoders, it’s a useless fucking skill and I don’t need a kid that knows how to prolapse a banana tree in O(n) time, I need someone that can design, implement and document and API.
4. Reading from a text during non technical interviews, we can tell you a googling stuff, the screen light on your face is changing, you look stupid, stop it. Story: we had one dude act like the video call was frozen and would just sit there without moving but we could see the reflection of the screen in his glasses change as he was googling answers to our basic questions. 
5.

I have been at a position where I will do both the first “get to know you” interviews and technical interviews, for SE positions at my current company, and I need to rant about a few things I have noticed. 

1. Fake resumes: the amount of people who lie on their resumes is insane, not only about the technologies they used but also about their work experience and education. It makes it harder for real applicants to get noticed and it makes it harder for us to hire them…
2. Unable to answer basic questions: don’t say you have implemented technology X if you can’t tell me what the fuck you did with technology X. It’s fine if you don’t know the details of technology X, but tell me how you interacted with it. 
3. (This one is for the companies hiring) stop pushing candidates to be competitive code gamers like leetcoders, it’s a useless fucking skill and I don’t need a kid that knows how to prolapse a banana tree in O(n) time, I need someone that can design, implement and document and API.
4. Reading from a text during non technical interviews, we can tell you a googling stuff, the screen light on your face is changing, you look stupid, stop it. Story: we had one dude act like the video call was frozen and would just sit there without moving but we could see the reflection of the screen in his glasses change as he was googling answers to our basic questions.

1h513ip,This industry is exhausting,"I'm sure this isn't a unique post, but curious how others are managing the apparent requirements of career growth. I'm going through the process of searching for a new job as my current role is uninspiring. 6YoE, and over the past few months I've had to spend over a hundred hours:

* Solving random, esoteric coding puzzles just to ""prove"" I can write code.
* Documenting every major success (and failure) from the past five years of my career.
* Prepping stories for each of these so I’m ready to answer even the weirdest behavioral questions.
* Constantly tweaking my resume with buzzwords, metrics that sometimes don’t even make sense, and tailoring it for every role because they’re asking for hyper-specific experience that clearly isn’t necessary.
* Completing 5+ hour take-home assignments, only to receive little more than a ""looks good"" in response.
* Learning how to speak in that weird, overly polished ""interview language"" that I *never* use in my day-to-day.
* Reviewing new design patterns, system design methodologies, and other technical concepts.
* Researching each organization, hiring team, and the roles of the 6–10 people I meet during the interview process.

Meanwhile, nobody in the process is an ally and there are constant snakes in the grass. I've had recruiters that:

* Aggressively push for comp numbers up front so they can use them against me later.
* Lie about target compensation, sometimes significantly.
* Encourage me to embellish my resume.
* Bait-and-switch me with unrelated roles just to get me on a call.
* Bring me to the offer stage for one role, only to stall it while pitching me something completely different.

And hiring companies that:

* Demand complete buy-in to their vision and process but offer no reciprocal commitment to fairness.
* Insist you know intricate details about their specific tech stacks or obscure JS frameworks, even when these are trivial to learn on the job.
* Drag out the interview process by adding extra calls to ""meet the team.""
* Use the ""remote"" designation to justify lowball salary offers, framing them as ""competitive"" because you're up against candidates from LCOL areas—while pocketing savings on office costs.
* Define ""competitive compensation"" however they want, then act shocked when candidates request market-rate pay for their area.

After all this effort, I’m now realizing I still have to learn comp negotiation strategies to deal with lowballs. I’ve taken time off work, spent dozens of hours prepping, and then get offers that don’t even beat my current comp.

At this point, I’m starting to wonder if I’m falling behind my peers—whether it’s networking, building skills, or even just pay. Are sites like [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) actually accurate, or are those numbers inflated? Why am I grinding out interviews to get a $150k no-equity offer from a startup when it sure looks like everyone at a public tech company is making $300k?

**This whole process is** ***exhausting***. I'm fortunate to not need a new job immediately, but this process has pushed me to the brink of a nervous breakdown. I'm starting to lose confidence in my desire to stay in the industry. How hard must I work to prove that I can do my job? Every stage of this process demands so much of your time - it feels like a full-time job.

Am I missing career hacks or tools that could simplify this? Are there strong resources to make any part of this easier?

I've come to realize I should be maintaining and building some of these skillsets as part of my regular work. But when you're already working 35–45 hours a week, how are you supposed to find time to keep up while also maintaining a lifestyle worth living?

1gyr486,Breathe - this is the time to prep for January hiring ,"Hi everyone 
Just a reminder that this time of year is notoriously challenging to get hired. 

Companies will lock their budgets down in an effort to show as much of a return as possible and hiring managers are going to be out on vacation due to the holidays. 

The last 2 weeks are gonna be a ghost town everywhere in December due to mid week holidays of Christmas and new years. 


Deep breathes

Prep for January and keep attacking . Start your planning and review what you want to be doing , where you want to do it and who you want to work for and work with.  For some of you it may be time to think to relocate as well. Plan it out. It takes upwards of 2 years to get assimilated into a new city / country depending on how far you are gonna leap. 

All plans go to shit once the first shot gets fired but putting something together will be helpful with research.  

Expect budgets and planning meetings to kick off in January with more roles coming in February.

Also I had no idea before this job how much people skills matter hugely. Because of this, I don't want my teammates to dislike working with me because they find me slow/bad/annoying. However I'm still learning how to be a good team player (adding more than I'm taking away, trying to be positive and cheerful, etc etc).

This is genuinely so bad that I haven't been sleeping recently from stress or trying to make up for this all by working until late at night.

Also I had no idea before this job how much people skills matter hugely. Because of this, I don't want my teammates to dislike working with me because they find me slow/bad/annoying. However I'm still learning how to be a good team player (adding more than I'm taking away, trying to be positive and cheerful, etc etc).

This is genuinely so bad that I haven't been sleeping recently from stress or trying to make up for this all by working until late at night. I'm less worried about being fired immediately, and more worried about ruining my relationship with my manager and colleagues by constantly dragging everyone down and not delivering. Although I think if I keep this up and don't ask for advice here I might get PIP'd someday for real.",15,1886,1902,0.123,0.808,0.069,-0.9595,Negative,True,True,True

* We can’t wait to read your resume and (hopefully personality-filled) cover letter! Let us know what excites you about full-stack engineering, and help us get to know you better!
* If we think we might be a good fit for you, we’ll set up a 1-hour phone chat with Moses, a Back End Engineer on the team! He’ll tell you more about the role, and get a chance to hear about your experiences
* Next will be a second 30-minute phone interview with Greg, our CEO & Founder, where we’ll dive a bit more into your background
* We’ll then do a technical assessment with a couple of ReadMe engineers
* Finally, we’ll invite you to an ""onsite"" interview conducted over Zoom! These usually take 3.5 to 5 hours including an hour break in between. We are able to be flexible with the schedule and split it up over two days if that works best for you! We start with a 15-minute get-to-know-you with the people you’ll be interviewing with, and then have you talk with people one-on-one later on

I went through 2 round of interviews with 2 interviewers, and I got the news that they offered me the role essentially 2 hours after completing the final round.

The role wanted someone ASAP, and I knew I had to resign as soon as I could. I asked them multiple times if I was safe to send in my resignation letter to my current job, and 2 agents reassured that there was no issue once I received my onboarding process(which I did).

So I resigned, and the next day, they told me the client doesn’t want to continue anymore. I can’t know why since it apparently has to do with some “compliance” issues between the agency and Loblaws Digital. So now, I’m left jobless and they’re saying the process is just left on hold with no definite resolution or answer. I feel Miserable. How can something like this happen?? I’ve never heard of anything like this happening before, going through the whole process and getting the worst outcome in the end.

1ih1kot,DESPERATE. Laid off after 7 years and my skills are way behind in today’s market. Please help.,"I got my first job out of college as a Front End Developer. I worked at a very small company for the past 7 years, making internal employee apps. 

Mainly worked jQuery. Strongest in CSS.

Not proficient in Angular or React. No experience with next, testing (we did it manually), monorepos. 

I was laid off 3 weeks ago and got a rude awakening realizing how outdated my former workplace was. My skills do not match up to current job postings. I had two interviews last week, secured through referral, and both told me my skills are too far behind.

I’m panicking because I have a family I provide for, including two young kids. In my previous role I was making 90k…. Now I’m fearing I can’t even make half that. 

I need some advice on how to improve my marketability FAST. What’s the fast track to boosting my skills and making me employable again?

Please, no snarky comments. I feel low enough as it is. I’m honestly depressed.

1i6pgvt,PIP pointers - lesson 1 : what to do when you’re PIP’d ,"It’s the season. Going to post when you’re PIP’d as well as tactics to avoid it. Since every place and leader is different in why they PIP I’ll start with after it happens what to do. 

First rule of PIPs - it’s not your fault. It wasn’t the right fit for whatever half assed reason your employer decides to come up with. Hopefully you have a clue of it coming but people get PIP’d because there isn’t enough ammo to just term you or to get rid of your position. The company is divorcing with you and you have to move out. And don’t forget to take those LPs too. 


Rule #2 of a PIP = paid interview period. They are giving you the time to interview for a new role. You cannot come back from a PIP when HR now knows who you are. Interview , network , and get out of dodge.  It’s likely going to take 7+ weeks for your next gig. So use this time wisely. 

Rule #3 - make actual doctors appointments — you paid for the benefits , get caught up on everything and let your doctors know that you’re likely going to lose  your benefits. They will find spots for you. Get extra medication if you require it just so you aren’t without it or have to reduce your intake. 

Rule #4 - don’t do anything before or after work hours. You are going to be fired. Putting in extra time now or on call is just a bad idea. Travel? Nope. RTO? Whatever your minimum is so you can collect a pay check to look do it. What are they going to do ? Fire you ? OK. 

Rule #5 - do not let the bastards get you down. Just because you got let go doesn’t mean you need to abandon your friends at your old firm. If they weren’t your direct boss , totally cool to hang out and chat. 

Rule #6 - make sure you are familiar with your states unemployment office and any services you may qualify for. You have paid into unemployment and the services they offer. Leverage everything you can. YMMV. Know what documents you may need to bring In or what the unemployment process it.  In my case I got let go after going away for my 2 weeks of annual training in the military reserves because my impact was too much on the team. I was able to leverage an ombudsman who was a retired general to up the amount of pay out for me significantly. 


Rule 7 - go to the mattresses financially: any major expenses you were planning on spending money on or minor expenses you need to itemize immediately. Cut everything out so you can reduce your burn as much as possible.  


Getting a PIP sucks but it’s just going to be a temporary sting you will move on from.

1fu822g,Is all company code a dumpster fire?,"In my first tech job, at a MAANG company. I'm a software engineer.

We have a lot of smart people, but dear god is everything way more complicated than it needs to be. We have multiple different internal tools that do the same thing in different ways for different situations.

For example, there are multiple different ways to ssh into something depending on the type of thing you're sshing into. And typically only one of them works (the specific one for that use case). Around 10-20% of the time, none of them work and I have to spend a couple of hours diving down a rabbit hole figuring that out.

Acronyms and lingo are used everywhere, and nobody explains what they mean. Meetings are full of word soup and so are internal documents. I usually have to spend as much time or more deciphering what the documentation is even talking about as I do following the documentation. I usually understand around 25% of what is said in meetings because of the amount of unshared background knowledge required to understand them.

Our code is full of leftover legacy crap in random places, comments that don't match the code, etc. Developers seem more concerned without pushing out quick fixes to things than cleaning up and fixing the ever-growing trash heap that is our codebase.

On-call is an excercise of frantically slapping duct tape on a leaky pipe hoping that it doesn't burst before it's time to pass it on to the next person.

I understand that the market is tough right now and it might feel like a privilege to even have a job, which may cause you to justify overworking and letting your higher-ups pile up work on you way outside of your compensation

You’re not obligated to do work outside of your scope or “prove that you’re a good engineer”. You’re not obligated to do backend or devops job if you’re in frontend and vice versa, neither are you obligated to do extra in tasks that were evaluated for half the work.

The stress and health impact from pushing yourself so much because someone told you “if you won’t then some other guy will” isn’t worth it and isn’t sustainable.

1my45y1,"Reminder: Software engineering is still one of the happiest careers in 2024/2025, based on data.","This subreddit has a huge FAANG obsession, and it completely distorts the perception of software engineering. Every other post seems to be about insane comp packages, grueling interviews, layoffs, or burnout stories. But if you look at the actual data, the reality for most developers is completely different.

[Resume.io (2025)](https://resume.io/blog/which-professions-are-the-happiest-at-work) found that 87 percent of software developers reported being “very happy” in their jobs, the highest of any profession surveyed. 

[Career.io (2024)](https://career.io/career-advice/careers-that-make-americans-happiest) analyzed nearly 756,000 job ratings and found software developers among the most satisfied six figure earners, with a median salary around 130K. 

[Market.biz (2025)](https://market.biz/job-satisfaction-statistics/#job-satisfaction-statistics-in-different-industries) reported that 74 percent of tech professionals worldwide are satisfied with their jobs. 

So why does this subreddit feel so negative compared to those numbers? Because the voices dominating here are FAANG engineers or startup employees, and their experiences are extreme. Life inside FAANG is often miserable. Long hours, constant pressure to ship, endless internal politics, and the looming threat of layoffs make it feel like a treadmill you can never step off. Software is the company’s entire product, so everything you do is under constant scrutiny and pressure. Burnout is common, and that is exactly what this sub amplifies.

Meanwhile, the average developer lives a completely different life, and that is what drives the high happiness statistics. Most are not in San Francisco or New York. They live in mid sized cities or suburbs where their salary goes much further. They are not chasing the next billion dollar app. They work at hospitals, insurance companies, banks, logistics firms, or government agencies. The work is steady, respected, and meaningful, even if it never makes headlines.

They make 100K to 130K, comfortably above the national median. Their hours are closer to forty a week. They get PTO. Their managers are competent but not tyrannical. And because software is a support function rather than the company’s core product, the pressure to grind nonstop is low. That is why surveys consistently show high satisfaction.

The quiet majority of developers who live this life rarely post here. Nobody makes a thread to say “My job is stable, I like my team, I worked normal hours, and I had a great weekend hiking.” The loud minority who post are often FAANG engineers or startup refugees talking about their misery. That is why this subreddit can make software engineering seem miserable, even though for most people it is not.

The truth is that chasing FAANG is often what ruins people’s perception of software engineering. It is the exception, not the rule. The average developer is happy, balanced, and living a peaceful, stable, and well-compensated life.
