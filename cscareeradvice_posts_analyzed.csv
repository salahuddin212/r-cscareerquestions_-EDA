1npk2bp,Should I Move ?,"2 years ago, I got relocated to a different state in a small city. After considering all factors, my spouse and I decided we should live apart for at least 2 years before either of us decided to move and live together.

I know it’s going to be difficult but am I underestimating how difficult this is going to be? I also have no background in CS in any way whatsoever so I am starting from complete zero.

I’m a reasonably motivated person, though I think motivation, discipline and time management are just a few of the challenges I have to be ready to face. I also decided I am going to do homeschooling to possibly combine studies with a part time job.

I heard that CS is also over saturated right now, not to mention that it will be hard to find a job being a fresh graduate. AI is also rapidly developing and I’m wondering if this will also help in plummeting demands for developers.

So, am I making a mistake?
I will be 30 and a fresh graduate by the time I finish.
Is it gonna be worth it? Am I resilient and intelligent enough to see it through?
Or do I just quit and continue working a slightly above average paying job?

1nov2wh,Feeling Lost in Software Engineering – Advice Needed,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to get some perspective and guidance from this community.

I recently graduated with a CS degree and landed my first full-time software engineering role earlier this year. I know I have such an amazing opportunity and beyond lucky to have experienced an internship and then offered a full time job at the same company. I want to be completely truthful though and will accept any and all feedback on my situation.

I didn't have a traditional CS background, tbh I only used the terminal and anything programming about 3 years ago. I was originally a Biomed student and I did graduate with that degree but I had a lot of mental health and confidence issues get in the way to pursue something further (like pharmacy, PA, ...). I took a year off and started to discover CS and enrolled into a CS bachelor's program. It was probably the hardest time of my life, I really struggled between the online courses with little interaction with peers and teachers, as well as just learning CS in general. For a little context, I was a total nerd and straight As in Organic Chemistry, Microbio... but I remember feeling so dumb and thinking to myself if this is how peers in my biomed classes that were failing felt. The whole degree was rough, I dropped a semester, scraped by some classes with a C. The one thing I can truly give myself grace with, is that I was always studying, making projects, and trying to learn outside of school, and I think it's the only reason I am somewhat surviving in my job given it's nature(C# microservices, Angular, SSMS, Docker, ADO).

I started the job very excited, eager to learn, but the last 3-4 months have been very hard for me. I tend to struggle with most bugs I get, whether it's difficulty with business logic, tracing down the error, or understanding the possible cause. I mean all this and I've barely written code to fix issues, it's typically one line to update query filtering, or add a null check, I can't imagine having to solve more complex problems, and this might also be because of how low my self confidence has gotten. I go into most tasks now with fear, anxiety, and rarely without a breakdown. Besides this, I feel like I bother my seniors, or can't make significant progress until they are available, making me feel really guilty and useless in that time between. The one cavoite to all these feelings is that my boss suggests me not to worry and that I'm doing well, so do my seniors and tech lead and my reviews are all very positive. I cannot explain this in a better way to understand, but there are days I make no progress, most of the time not understanding majority of the processes and code we look over. I mean I even have trouble understanding how code gets promoted and how the pipelines work. I can give examples such as being told there might me a deadlock on a thread, bus messages not registering properly, concurrency holding up requests, and it all really just goes over my head. I really don't mean to ramble, I just want to provide some insight on how I feel and understand because I know with good reviews, most will say it's imposter syndrome.

I'm also feeling really depressed and lonely, as much as I do enjoy being able to work remote, I'm really missing working alongside peers and growing and learning from them. Thirty minutes twice a day in a group meeting with strangers in different states and countries just doesn't seem like the healthiest environment for me. And as much as I could go into the office, there's hardly anyone there, and those that are don't ever speak to me. I know this is partially on me as well, but I am shy and quiet, and the low self confidence really makes me timid to try and spark up conversations with all these seniors.

I don’t want to quit; at least not without knowing I gave it everything I had. I want to get better and feel competent. At the moment, I have a few thoughts: maybe it’s the company/industry and I’d be better suited somewhere that aligns with my interests. But that’s a gamble in this market, and if the issue is more about my skills and confidence, it would follow me anywhere. Another thought is pivoting back to my biomed degree, but even then it seems like people are trying to do the opposite and suggesting me to stay. This puts me at a hard crossroads, I’m struggling mentally and I can’t go on like this for much longer. Honestly, I was happier as a pharmacy tech or even a stock clerk, and that thought really scares me.

I'm not sure if any new devs relate to this level of feeling incompetent and unfit for the field or if it's an extreme level of imposter syndrome, but I could really use some advice, good or bad.

I appreciate anyone taking their time out to read or even reply. It would mean so much.

Here’s my current situation:

Skills: Basics of Python, HTML/CSS/JS, some NLP, some Docker, some DB, some FastAPI , basic problem solving like pattern solving. Most of my work so far is with LLMs and AI IDEs.

Weakness: I haven't done much serious DSA, system design, or real projects at scale.

Confusion: Should I go for GATE (Feb 2026)? Should I focus on MERN + DSA or AIML? AIML feels future-proof but also competitive (favoring tier-1/2 grads). I'm worried I don't have enough time to master ML properly.

Goals:

Get a solid job before graduation (preferably good pay,  about 8-10 lpa).

Hit 20+ LPA within 3 years.

Avoid being stuck in a mediocre low-paying job.

I want a brutally honest assessment:

Am I delusional or is this achievable with my current timeline?

What should be my exact focus areas for the next 6–12 months?
Should I spend time on GATE prep for mtech in IIT or skip it entirely?

1noe854,Work in startup?,"Guys, a few months ago I started working at a startup in Argentina. I had about a year and a half of experience building web projects for clients and a degree as a Web Development Technician. In this job, they use a different language from the one I trained in, but they gave me my first professional opportunity and I’m learning a lot. For now, I take care of reviewing bugs, creating interfaces, and making some changes in the backend and database. The difference is that now I see everything on a larger scale, with more complex architectures.

The problem is that we don’t have much organization: we’re always rushing, with urgent issues and clients reporting problems. I’m a Junior, but I can debug and modify business logic code with prior review (PR). My leader is also a Junior who comes from web design, and he’s supervised by my boss, which sometimes makes communication a bit complicated. Still, I feel I’m learning a lot about processes, queues, and concurrency.

What bothers me is the lack of organization and the number of issues, or having to leave something halfway to jump to another task because it came up. But since I’m new, I don’t want to suggest changes just yet. Is it normal for a startup to be like this?

1nnvloo,Have a question about my manager's management style,"Hey everyone,

I currently work for a global corporate company (eg.  for apps) and wanted to get your comments on my manager’s management style and how to cope with it.

My boss hardly ever emails, leaves very vague IM responses (lots of times not fully answering questions) and makes impromptu phone calls without any warning or preparation of what the subject will be in hand.  With these calls, she goes through her details extremely quickly to the point where I don’t feel like I am absorbing material fully.  Keep in mind, these unplanned calls involve VERY sensitive pieces of information that have a great impact on the business.  On top of that, she’s got an academic mindset and asks a lot of “what do you think you should do here?” questions which happens often.  My first thought was ALWAYS (you tell me, it’s your job to be clear on how I need this done).  I never truly say this though so I come up with a simple answer that might make sense.

When I’m done with this ask, it’s usually never what she expected initially.  Keep in mind, I take summarized notes on the side based on phone conversations.  I also ask to potentially clarify things here or there to answer questions on what I think she’s talking about.  Sadly, it becomes a guessing game as to what the end product looks like.  When we go over what she is looking for, it NEVER dawned on me to go down this avenue of thinking that she expects.

As a result, we talked about these numerous occasions and I proposed the idea of making “half-way” calls  to see if these are the results she is looking for.  She insisted that I should just take notes the first time, refine the notes to what makes the most sense and THEN complete the task. 

Maybe I’m just crazy but I feel like this manager is doing the absolute bear minimum to “manage.” I’ve worked with previous managers with all different styles but have never come across this.   

I’ve thought about doing follow-up summary emails based on conversations we’ve had but I don’t want to get on her bad side since this is clearly a CYA method.

1nnhmdg,Cue cards during behavioural interview,"If you have a bunch of experience examples that can be used for answers in behavioural interviews, how do you organise them in cue cards that make it easy and simple to digest during an interview. Let's just assume it's a remote interview so it's a little bit easier to have cue card notes.

So two top level questions:

1. Given the many to many relationship (i.e. one question can have many examples and one example can be used for many questions).
2. I follow the STAR format when answering, how do you write the cue card notes? Do you have a couple of lines to trigger what the example is about or do you have bullet point notes for each section S, T, A and R?

My current technique is to write examples with a bullet point list under each section S, T, A and R. And each item in the list has a couple of words at the start highlighted which should be enough to remind me what the rest of the line says. But if I forget then at least I have the rest of the line. That way, most of the time I only need to scan the highlighted trigger words at the start of the line.

Each of these example notes are Obsidian pages (I have a completely new vault just for this). I then have a separate page which lists the various context I may be asked questions e.g. against the company's core values or commonly asked behavioural questions. Against these, I then link the pages that an example may apply to.

This then creates something that feels like a website with hyperlink structure. I can quickly navigate between examples and easily capture the many to many relationship.

What do others do and how does it work? Are people using an effective hard copy note system?

1nmyg97,Is this normal for a first dev job? Or should I be worried?,"I recently started working at a small firm in my local area. I got in because of a new online gaming platform they’re building. The platform itself is pretty ambitious: realtime communication, scalability, and the manager wants it production-ready ASAP.

I was really excited at first. The manager asked me to start right away—even recommending I initiate the repo—but there were some problems…

**1. No requirement specs**  
I wasn’t given any requirement specification at all. I didn’t want to hold things back, so I took the initiative and started gathering requirements myself. But week after week, new major features kept getting added. It feels endless.

**2. The database mess**  
Once I gathered enough for an SRS, I started designing the database. But the PM wanted to take that on, saying it would “help strengthen the requirements.” Fine, I let him.  
Then he sent me his first draft, and honestly—it was *one of the worst schemas I’ve ever seen*. Here’s what an AI review of it said:

* Overuse of JSON instead of normalized tables
* Polymorphic foreign keys (OperatorGame, OperatorGameAccess)
* Duplicate game/session models (AdminGame vs UserGame)
* Nullable unique fields (emails, operator IDs)
* Inconsistent primary key strategies
* Secrets stored in plain text (passwords, API keys, 2FA)
* Too many indexes planned — risks over-indexing
* Overloaded User table (auth, stats, operator)
* Money stored as Decimal(10,2) (not safe for multiple currencies)
* Weak referential integrity in places
* Inconsistent naming conventions
* Invitation model could allow duplicates/circular relations

I redesigned the schema and sent him my draft. His reply? *“We shouldn’t waste any more time on the database schema, let’s just start building features now.”*  
That doesn’t sit right with me—if the schema isn’t normalized, it’ll be hell to work with later.

I started working on some game item features. Then the PM told me to stop and focus only on realtime features, because “another dev” would handle those items. That was the first time I even heard about another dev. Apparently, he’s working in a separate repo and building a service-oriented architecture.

But here’s the problem:

* We don’t know who’s working on what
* There’s no plan for how we’ll communicate API/database changes

1nm0nuv,Need advice: Should I choose AI role with office work or company-assigned WFH role?,"  
Hi everyone, I recently got a new job and I’ve been given two options:

1. **Take an AI role** – but I’ll have to work from the office. My house is very far, and it takes almost 2 hours to reach. Office timings are 11 AM to 8 PM (official) but sometimes go till 10 PM.
2. **Take the role assigned by the company (not AI)** – but I can work from home.

I’m concerned about my future:

* If I take the AI role, I’ll gain direct AI experience which is great for career growth. But I’ll lose 4 hours daily in travel, which means less time for self-learning and rest.

Hi everyone, I recently got a new job and I’ve been given two options:

1. **Take an AI role** – but I’ll have to work from the office. My house is very far, and it takes almost 2 hours to reach. Office timings are 11 AM to 8 PM (official) but sometimes go till 10 PM.
2. **Take the role assigned by the company (not AI)** – but I can work from home.

I’m concerned about my future:

* If I take the AI role, I’ll gain direct AI experience which is great for career growth. But I’ll lose 4 hours daily in travel, which means less time for self-learning and rest.
* If I take the company-assigned WFH role, I’ll save travel time and can use it for self-learning in AI, but I won’t get direct AI job experience right now.

I’m actively searching for new software engineer opportunities in the US and could really use some advice from those who’ve been through the process or are knowledgeable about the job market right now.

What strategies or resources have you found most effective for landing a software engineering role in today’s competitive market?

With so many job postings online but fierce competition, I’m especially curious about:

* Which networking techniques, platforms, or job search habits actually work in 2025?
* How impactful have referrals been for you or people you know?
* Any specific tips, communities, or resources that helped you get noticed?

1nku6l5,Should I stay or move on? Need advice on my career path,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a career dilemma and would love some outside perspective.

I’m currently working at a company where my role is Qualiy Engineer and writing manual test cases. The work is comfortable and doesn’t create a lot of pressure, but at the same time, I feel like I’m not really growing or moving towards my goal of becoming a developer.
	•	Experience so far: ~4 months
	•	Notice period: 3 months if I resign now
	•	Concern: If I stay, I might get too comfortable and miss out on opportunities to build dev skills. If I leave, I’ll need to justify switching so early in my career. Also I am not liking this place at all and my salary is not good it is around 4 LPA which is very low . I have tried fot relocation but they didn't care about it. So I thought to resign and make the next move.

I’ve also been applying for other ,but I’m unsure if moving this early will help or hurt my long-term path.

So my questions are:
	1.	Is it smarter to stick it out for at least a year for resume stability, or should I move on sooner if the work doesn’t align with my goals?
	2.	How do recruiters/managers generally view people leaving after 4–6 months?
	3.	Any advice for balancing career growth vs stability in these early years?

Would really appreciate honest feedback from people who’ve been in similar situations.

These are 5 practical tips that training often skips. I’d love feedback from this community.

1. Get a certification taht signals potential – A foundational cert (like CompTIA Security+) can get you through HR filters, but it’s only the start.
2. Build real projects, even without a job – Home labs like Wireshark, developing a mini incident response plan (IRP), or small volunteer projects all show initiative.
3. Create a portfolio that proves your skills – Document your projects, labs, and reports. A simple GitHub repo or PDF can set you apart from candidates who only list certs.
4. Develop the soft skills employees actually want – Research found employers consistently say communication inlcuding report writing and problem-solving are just as important as technical skills. Show you can explain risks clearly.
5. Set realistic expectations – It takes a good 9 to 12 months for an entry-level hire to get up to speed (know from personal experience). Get involve in the security networking world like going to ISACA events and connect with a mentor as it can make the journey faster.

So they couldn't hire me. Bummer. I aplied to another Flutter dev role, and was in an interview today. Basically what the interviewer said was, they really liked my history, being an entrepreneur and all, and if they only had a team they would instantly shake hands with me. But what they are currently looking for is someone with little more hands down experience with Flutter, to take more responsibilities. Someone they can build the team around... They didn't directly reject me right away, but i know when i'm being politely rejected. And i appreciate it. I know i'm inexperienced. God damn i'm beginning to lose faith. Maybe i wont break through, maybe i'm just too old to switch career. How do you guys deal with being rejected? It's tough especially when the job postings are rare these days.

Basically what the interviewer said was, they really liked my history, being an entrepreneur and all, and if they only had a team they would instantly shake hands with me. But what they are currently looking for is someone with little more hands down experience with Flutter, to take more responsibilities. Someone they can build the team around... They didn't directly reject me right away, but i know when i'm being politely rejected. And i appreciate it. I know i'm inexperienced. God damn i'm beginning to lose faith. Maybe i wont break through, maybe i'm just too old to switch career. How do you guys deal with being rejected? It's tough especially when the job postings are rare these days.

And any advice on how to gain more experience is really welcome 🙏

1njt400,Majoring in Eletrical/Computer Engineering for SWE,"tldr; Would my Engineering + Math degree hurt my chances of getting SWE or ML related roles?

Hey, I'm a college freshman dreaming of building & shipping. My initial major was CS and Math, but I found that the CS part is not challenging enough in this school. Because it's a top liberal arts school, it doesn't have a DS degree or state-of-the-art tech classes. So I wanted to start taking engineering classes more from the next semester - would it hurt my chances of interning at a big tech as a SWE or applying for full-time job positions?

You see, since it's a LAC, my college doesn't give a degree for Computer/Electrical, but just a general Engineering Degree (but of course I'll take CE/EE specialized courses), so I'm seriously concerned about that. Please, let me know what founders & PR think about a major being not CS but Engineering (specific - CE or EE)?

1njeb8l,Why does this field feel so souless,"I want to hear your suggestion or your experience, if you relate to me in anyway or if you dont and how so.
 


Ever since I was a kid, When teachers used to give us homework essays on topic like ""Your aim"" , I've always either wrote youtuber or programmer. Well Right now for YouTubing, I haven't tried it and I want to get started but it's a different struggle. I choose BCA degree and pursued to be a ""developer"" as my main lifeline wealth source.

I have tried many fields. Such as:- 

1. 2d Game development (which was my main motivation, but the more I started digging deeper the more I found out that they are usually underpaid and usually requires to be working in a group rather than working in an Indie environment. Overall my impression was that this pursue though may feel very rewarding after getting the result but sounds risky. But deep down if this persuit was not so risky I'd probably do it)

2. 3D development (tried blender, wanted to take creative and artistic route which I believe that I excel at, but due to my hardware limitations I found that I can't pursue them to the level I want to. It lags even when I try to render basic models) 

3. Cybersecurity (sure, I may get a superpower. And I will also get a potentially a good job but so far from every cybersecurity affiliated individuals i see, I see no soul in their eyes and neither do I want to be like that. I don't think it's a ""creative"" field either. Not to mention I will have to panic 24/7 while being alert for attacks. And no freelancing capabilities) 

4. UX and Web development (this is the one that I'm currently going with. I'm heavily emphasizing on UX and doing web development to just have something where I can use my UX knowledge on.) 





 Despite doing all these, maybe the only thing that has sticked with me so far is UX cause of its ""empathy"" aspect. I wish i joined psychology, cause lowkey thats what i fw the most but my parents adviced agaisnt it cause where i live at the scope is pretty close to nil. Even my choice on UX was based on psychology by how UX needs to be very wary of cognitive biases to not make rash assumptions or decisions. Despite UX, why does cs feels so dam souless.

1nj8wt0,My Startup Internship-to-Placement Story,"Hi everyone,

During my final year of engineering, a startup visited our campus for placements. They selected 10 students, including me. Since I had a confirmed full-time offer, my college didn’t allow me to sit for other drives.

The company gave us an offer letter with both internship + full-time conversion, with detailed compensation. Naturally, I was thrilled and celebrated my first job offer. But soon reality hit:

* Joining was delayed by 2 months
* The “office” turned out to be just 2 rented benches in another company’s space, with no branding
* Internship lasted 6 months, where we were trained on MuleSoft and given use cases to solve
* Midway, they changed terms from *guaranteed* full-time conversion to *performance-based* offers
* At the end, they told us no full-time offers were possible because “clients backed off”

By then, we had already graduated. Since placements for our batch were over, my college couldn’t help me. Now I’m in the market as a fresher — and as you all know, the current IT job market is really tough.

That said, I’m not giving up. Along the way, I’ve worked on projects like:

* **Event RSVP & Attendance Manager** – a full-stack app (Spring Boot, MongoDB, React.js)
* **Wild Animal Detection System** – ML-based alert system (ResNet, VGG, BiLSTM)

1nh63e1,Advice for quitting my extremely unprofessional job (am I crazy?),"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Long post ahead.

I graduated with my BS in computer science with a concentration in computer programming near the end of 2024. Ideally, I want to pursue software development, but the current job market combined with living in a relatively rural area has made securing a developer job extremely difficult. I submitted hundreds of applications over a course of months and had no luck, even if I made it through a first interview.

After a while, I ended up getting an entry-level IT help desk job for a small healthcare organization. It advertised that no experience was necessary, and the highest level of education required was a high school diploma. Even though I was overqualified, I was happy to finally find something that would serve as experience on my resume. 

When I interviewed and agreed to my hire, nothing stood out to me as particularly suspicious or unprofessional. The team consisted of an IT director, a sysadmin, a help desk supervisor, me, and another help desk technician. The director (who I will call Hank) expressed that he felt I would learn a lot in my role and that the organization likes to promote from within, so there was a lot of potential for growth. He also mentioned that they would pay for me to get certs, and I was excited about that opportunity. 

The first red flag is that my fellow help desk tech (who I will call K) wasn't actually technically qualified to train me. The organization requires that anyone training new hires must take a workshop going over best practices, guidelines, and professionalism. K had a conversation with an employee from another department (in front of me) that she hadn't taken this course and wasn't getting paid to train me. I expressed my surprise at this, but everyone else seemed to pass it off as normal, so I let it go and proceeded as if this was no issue.

Additionally, after about a month I was told that there was ""sort of an 'anything goes' atmosphere"" in our department. I had not been met with any outright unprofessionalism at this point, but this seemed to be my coworkers dipping their toes into that water. We are fairly isolated from the other departments, so anything that is said in the office really does stay there unless someone were to tell others. They assured me that if anyone ever said anything I found distasteful or offensive, I could speak up and they would correct it. This left me feeling a little uneasy, but it didn't come off as hostile, so I let it slide. However, I did get the feeling that my coworkers were sort of pretending to be on their ""best behavior"" and censoring/holding back around me. 

At around the same time, it was time for the employees to complete an annual, anonymous, department-specific employee satisfaction survey. This was when my director (Hank) said something that I perceived as a HUGE red flag. I hadn't been working there long enough to participate in the survey, but he said he wanted to advise me on how to approach it when that time came. He essentially said that he wasn't directly telling me how to fill out the survey, but that everyone else in the department gives a perfect score. He said that this was because if we give even a near-perfect score, we have to come up with goals as a department and document how we're approaching them, and he feels that was a waste of time that would be better spent doing other things. Additionally, he said that he feels if I had any dissatisfaction, I should tell either my supervisor or him instead of an anonymous survey. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and that feeling worsened when the help desk team expressed that the only reason they started giving perfect scores was because Hank would complain excessively about the goal-meeting quota when they were honest. Given we are a small department, if I were to be honest on this survey, it would be extremely clear who gave a less-than-perfect score. However, since it didn't directly affect me yet, I also put it aside. 

Over the course of the next few months, my coworkers slowly started revealing less than professional behavior around me. It began with use of what I personally consider to be a slur- the r-word used to describe individuals with different mental capabilities. The first time I heard it, I expressed that the word made me uncomfortable and I felt it had no use in a professional environment. My coworkers expressed that they meant no malintent and that they don't feel negatively towards those individuals, but that they merely use the word to express frustration with difficult users and staff. I explained that this didn't change my feelings, and they said they would stop using the word. However, this just led to them making what I felt to be big, performative apologies whenever they would ""mistakenly"" say the word in front of me. These scenes made me more uncomfortable than before, so I ended up telling them that it wouldn't ruin my day if I did hear the word, but I would appreciate their efforts not to use it in front of me. However, I feel that they took this as an all-clear to say it whenever they want. I have heard this word every day, multiple times a day, for months. 

Furthermore, the whole department uses edgy humor that I personally find unprofessional. Don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to dark humor myself. However, I have heard some things that I think would make any reasonable person uncomfortable. For example, Hank once put on a segment from one of his favorite comedians that was essentially just a three-minute lead up to a graphic (g)r@p3 joke. As a young woman who has been a victim of sexual assault myself, I was IMMEDIATELY triggered by this- but my entire department laughed at it. This cemented the foundation that if I were to speak up about things that make me uncomfortable, I will just be ignored, worn down, or gaslit into believing that it's no big deal. This is just one example of that type of overt, offensive dark ""humor.""

Additionally, I find the way my coworkers interact with me and each other to be very weird and unprofessional. They insist that they are ""like a family"" and thus that excuses this behavior, and that they are ""just giving you/each other shit"" as a means of affection. For example, it is common for Hank to call K stupid/half-witted/the r-word, and she even refers to herself that way on a fairly regular basis. It is ALWAYS passed off as a joke, but even so, it makes me uncomfortable, and it happens regularly. 

I also feel that my supervisor (who I will call Q) and K talk about overly personal parts of their lives and expect me to do the same. For example, I shared that I need to leave 10 minutes early once a week to attend therapy after work. After this, K asks me often how therapy is going and has even gone so far as to ask what I talk about IN FRONT OF the rest of my coworkers. When I express that I don't want to talk about it, she tells me that she's always there for me and that she just wants to ""look after my mental health."" I have expressed to my supervisor (Q) that this makes me uncomfortable, and he says that is a conversation I should have with K directly and that she really means nothing but good by it. Additionally, Q often brings up ""hot button"" topics such as the recent Charlie Kirk shooting and his personal opinions on the morality of sex work and hookup culture, among other things. I feel that these are discussions that have no place in a professional environment in general, but it is also worth noting that I feel differently about these issues than my coworkers and the rest of the community in general, which puts me in an especially tight spot when they are brought up.

I also just find the way my coworkers interact with me and each other to be very weird and unprofessional. They insist that they are ""like a family"" and thus that excuses this behavior, and that they are ""just giving you/each other shit"" as a means of affection. For example, it is common for Hank to call K stupid/half-witted/the r-word, and she even refers to herself that way on a fairly regular basis. There are also regular jokes about how they're ""going to end up in HR one day"" when something offensive is said, so it's not like they are completely oblivious to the fact all of this is problematic and unprofessional. It is ALWAYS passed off as a joke, but even so, it makes me uncomfortable, and it happens regularly. 

This leads into a really big issue I have been experiencing, which is the fact that I am met with passive aggressive for wanting to take my lunch break. I was told by Hank when I was hired that he encourages me to take my full lunch break away from the office. However, everyone (including him) eats at their desk and work through their lunch. We do not get any other guaranteed breaks, so they essentially never take a break. This is something that K is EXTREMELY proud of, and she often boasts about her work ethic because of it. At first, I did the same because I wanted to fit in, but the lack of breaks eventually started taking a toll on me after a few months. I started taking a lunch, but I always ask if it is a good time for the team as we are a small group and I want to do my best to not leave them in a tight spot if possible. When this happens, I am always met with passive-aggression passed off as jokiness from K and Hank. For example, they might say something like ""what, you don't want to hang out with us?"" or ""I see you're finally getting tired of us; we'll prepare for you to not come back."" I personally have trauma surrounding my meals being controlled (having to ask for permission, being given a certain amount of time to eat, etc), so this is all VERY triggering for me. I have honestly started not taking lunches entirely some days to avoid it. 

Finally, in the last few months I've worked there, it seems that K always has something to say about how I do my job. We are in the same position, and we both signed a document notifying HR that I have completed my training. In my eyes, this makes us peers; she is not my superior. She has worked there longer than me, and I am absolutely willing to take guidance from her, but it seems that nothing I do is ever right. She regularly listens to my phone calls with users (even if she is on the phone as well) and will tell me that she would have done something differently. What is perhaps the most confusing and frustrating to me is that these comments often contradict each other. One example is I received a call from a user that their mouse died, so I let them know I would bring them a replacement and did so immediately. When I came back to the office, K told me that since Q was also away from the office at that time, she felt I should have waited to run the mouse since it left her as the only help desk employee there. I apologized and told her I would take this into consideration in the future. Sure enough, I ran into the same situation; I informed the user I would run out their equipment as soon as possible and hung up. As soon as I hung up, K told me that not having functional equipment is an urgent matter and I should replace the equipment immediately. I have brought this up to both Q and K directly, but they both tell me that K is just trying to ""mentor"" me. I've found that it is easiest to just not argue and agree with K. 

At this time, I want to express that I do not feel comfortable going to HR about any of these issues. It would be glaringly obvious that I was the one that reported them, and I feel that I would be met with more hostility than it's worth. All of these issues combined have led to my decision to turn in my resignation at the end of this week. I am going to give three weeks of notice, which I feel is plenty. However, due to the weird fake positivity and care in the office, I can't help but sometimes feel that I am making a big deal out of nothing and resigning is an overreaction. I wanted to get others' opinions, as this is my first job in tech and I'm not sure what the baseline is. 

Additionally, I want to ask for advice on approaching my resignation. We all share an office space, and it is very open, so there is no room for privacy. Should I ask my supervisor to speak privately, or should I simply email him my notice? Additionally, if I do ask to speak privately, should I present him with my letter at that time, or should I wait until after the conversation? Should I also give HR and my director a copy? 

Thank you in advance for any advice or guidance. Please be kind.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Long post ahead.

I graduated with my BS in computer science with a concentration in computer programming near the end of 2024. Ideally, I want to pursue software development, but the current job market combined with living in a relatively rural area has made securing a developer job extremely difficult. I submitted hundreds of applications over a course of months and had no luck, even if I made it through a first interview.

After a while, I ended up getting an entry-level IT help desk job for a small healthcare organization. It advertised that no experience was necessary, and the highest level of education required was a high school diploma. Even though I was overqualified, I was happy to finally find something that would serve as experience on my resume. 

When I interviewed and agreed to my hire, nothing stood out to me as particularly suspicious or unprofessional. The team consisted of an IT director, a sysadmin, a help desk supervisor, me, and another help desk technician. The director (who I will call Hank) expressed that he felt I would learn a lot in my role and that the organization likes to promote from within, so there was a lot of potential for growth. He also mentioned that they would pay for me to get certs, and I was excited about that opportunity. 

The first red flag is that my fellow help desk tech (who I will call K) wasn't actually technically qualified to train me. The organization requires that anyone training new hires must take a workshop going over best practices, guidelines, and professionalism. K had a conversation with an employee from another department (in front of me) that she hadn't taken this course and wasn't getting paid to train me. I expressed my surprise at this, but everyone else seemed to pass it off as normal, so I let it go and proceeded as if this was no issue.

Additionally, after about a month I was told that there was ""sort of an 'anything goes' atmosphere"" in our department. I had not been met with any outright unprofessionalism at this point, but this seemed to be my coworkers dipping their toes into that water. We are fairly isolated from the other departments, so anything that is said in the office really does stay there unless someone were to tell others. They assured me that if anyone ever said anything I found distasteful or offensive, I could speak up and they would correct it. This left me feeling a little uneasy, but it didn't come off as hostile, so I let it slide. However, I did get the feeling that my coworkers were sort of pretending to be on their ""best behavior"" and censoring/holding back around me. 

At around the same time, it was time for the employees to complete an annual, anonymous, department-specific employee satisfaction survey. This was when my director (Hank) said something that I perceived as a HUGE red flag. I hadn't been working there long enough to participate in the survey, but he said he wanted to advise me on how to approach it when that time came. He essentially said that he wasn't directly telling me how to fill out the survey, but that everyone else in the department gives a perfect score. He said that this was because if we give even a near-perfect score, we have to come up with goals as a department and document how we're approaching them, and he feels that was a waste of time that would be better spent doing other things. Additionally, he said that he feels if I had any dissatisfaction, I should tell either my supervisor or him instead of an anonymous survey. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and that feeling worsened when the help desk team expressed that the only reason they started giving perfect scores was because Hank would complain excessively about the goal-meeting quota when they were honest. Given we are a small department, if I were to be honest on this survey, it would be extremely clear who gave a less-than-perfect score. However, since it didn't directly affect me yet, I also put it aside. 

Over the course of the next few months, my coworkers slowly started revealing less than professional behavior around me. It began with use of what I personally consider to be a slur- the r-word used to describe individuals with different mental capabilities. The first time I heard it, I expressed that the word made me uncomfortable and I felt it had no use in a professional environment. My coworkers expressed that they meant no malintent and that they don't feel negatively towards those individuals, but that they merely use the word to express frustration with difficult users and staff. I explained that this didn't change my feelings, and they said they would stop using the word. However, this just led to them making what I felt to be big, performative apologies whenever they would ""mistakenly"" say the word in front of me. These scenes made me more uncomfortable than before, so I ended up telling them that it wouldn't ruin my day if I did hear the word, but I would appreciate their efforts not to use it in front of me. However, I feel that they took this as an all-clear to say it whenever they want. I have heard this word every day, multiple times a day, for months. 

Furthermore, the whole department uses edgy humor that I personally find unprofessional. Don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to dark humor myself. However, I have heard some things that I think would make any reasonable person uncomfortable. For example, Hank once put on a segment from one of his favorite comedians that was essentially just a three-minute lead up to a graphic (g)r@p3 joke. As a young woman who has been a victim of sexual assault myself, I was IMMEDIATELY triggered by this- but my entire department laughed at it. This cemented the foundation that if I were to speak up about things that make me uncomfortable, I will just be ignored, worn down, or gaslit into believing that it's no big deal. This is just one example of that type of overt, offensive dark ""humor.""

Additionally, I find the way my coworkers interact with me and each other to be very weird and unprofessional. They insist that they are ""like a family"" and thus that excuses this behavior, and that they are ""just giving you/each other shit"" as a means of affection. For example, it is common for Hank to call K stupid/half-witted/the r-word, and she even refers to herself that way on a fairly regular basis. It is ALWAYS passed off as a joke, but even so, it makes me uncomfortable, and it happens regularly.

1nh3ucw,Should I Consider a Contract Job?,"Hello all,

I’d appreciate your advice on whether I should take up a contract role.

I graduated in May 2025, with a Master’s in Computer Science and have been actively searching for full-time opportunities. So far, I’ve had three interviews, one of which reached the final round but didn’t work out.

Currently, an intermediary company has approached me for a **Software Data Engineer contract role with a well-known client**. The details are:

* **Rate:** $45/hour
* **Contract:** 1 year
* **Relocation:** Not provided
* **H1-B sponsorship:** Possible if performance is strong

At the same time, I’m still hopeful about the upcoming September–December hiring cycle for full-time positions.

For context, I am on **F-1 OPT** and currently working in a **research role at my university**, though the work is less relevant to my career interests (limited application and feature development) and this is a paid role where I can handle my living expenses.

Given this situation, should I take the contract opportunity now or wait a bit longer for potential full-time interviews? I’d really appreciate your suggestions and insights.

I only took one programming class in college that turned me off from it but it could've just been the professor that was bad. That also almost 20 years ago so things are probably easier to learn now

I've tried studying other fields in IT like networking but It didn't keep me engaged long enough to complete the cert.

1nfddq7,Job has plateaued..where to turn next?,"Hi, I have been working at my current job since 2022 was a hired directly out of a bootcamp. I have been at the company now for more than 3 years and the job has been pretty great overall. I have gotten proficient enough at my job that I can often get my work done pretty quick and since I am also remote I have pretty good work/life balance. Recently there has been some restructuring changes at work and it has become pretty clear that there is not much potential to increase my salary any time soon. I could definitely continue at this job for the next few years but I can't help but wonder if I should be pushing harder for a better opportunity elsewhere. I still only have 3 YOE under my belt so it's not like there are many options available to me in this highly competitive job market. 

I have the time at work however to focus on preparing for interviews if I chose to do so. I could even devote the next year to trying to get hired at Goggle or another big tech company. I am not sure what to do as I feel like it is always a big risk to leave a job you are very comfortable at. However the other part of me is worried about becoming stagnant and missing opportunities to grow more as a developer and increase my salary. As I said there is only one promotional opportunity at my job and this is a tech lead on one of the teams. I don't feel nearly experienced enough yet to take on something like this so I figure as long as I stay I should expect the same salary for some time to come.

I’ve been working as a Mainframe Developer for 4+ years in a service-based company-hyd, stuck with the same pay all these years. The workload is heavy, but growth is almost zero. I tried shifting earlier (even attempted CAT twice) but it didn’t work out.

Around 8 months ago, I enrolled in Scaler’s DSML course (Data Science & ML). But I still have many modules/projects left to complete. My long-term goal is to move into a Data Analyst / Data Scientist role, but right now it feels far.

So I’m confused —
👉 Should I switch jobs now in Mainframe itself for better pay and stability, then transition later into DS/ML once I finish the course?

I’ve been working as a Mainframe Developer for 4+ years in a service-based company-hyd, stuck with the same pay all these years. The workload is heavy, but growth is almost zero. I tried shifting earlier (even attempted CAT twice) but it didn’t work out.

Around 8 months ago, I enrolled in Scaler’s DSML course (Data Science & ML). But I still have many modules/projects left to complete. My long-term goal is to move into a Data Analyst / Data Scientist role, but right now it feels far.

So I’m confused —
👉 Should I switch jobs now in Mainframe itself for better pay and stability, then transition later into DS/ML once I finish the course?
👉 Or should I wait, finish the course first, and then try shifting directly into DS/ML?

1naq1a3,"Landed my dream SWE job, but fear procrastination will ruin it - anyone overcome this?","***TLDR:*** SWE with a strong background (non-CS engineering from a top 5 UK university) but long-term procrastination and motivation issues are stalling my technical growth. I’ve been in good trading firms and finally landed a dream job - but I fear I’ll sabotage it unless I break this cycle. Looking for advice from anyone who’s been through this and found a way out of the vicious cycle.

___

I feel my software engineering career stagnating and I’d like advice on how to improve.

***Context:***

I studied engineering (non-CS) at a top 5 British university and have been working for \~8 years, first at an investment bank and then multiple quantitative trading firms. I’ve always been a fairly “take-it-easy”, procrastinate-prone kind of person. Earlier in life things came easily to me but from around my final stretch at university, I really started to struggle with the lack of work ethic, i.e. procrastinating until the very last minute for exams/deadlines and then pulling all-nighters to finish things off. I scraped by and completed university with a 2:1. I narrowly missed a 1st class degree, which mostly doesn’t matter in the real world but did close doors for the best higher study programs. This still stings from time to time.

I started work as a grad SWE at an investment bank. It was boring - maybe partly because I expected it to be and didn’t apply myself. I coasted through, procrastinating most of the time at work. Outside of work, I was motivated to leave and worked really hard on interview skills. Eventually, I left for a mid-tier (for SWEs, fairly top-tier for quants) quantitative trading firm.

When I joined this firm, I was in peak mental shape - working out in the mornings, meditating at night. For the first 3-4 months, I was the wunderkind new kid on the block - my boss praised me for my work ethic (something *no one* had ever done before), I felt I was growing as an engineer technically and people were giving me responsibility. When a senior partner visited from another office and I introduced myself, he said “Ah, of course, I’ve heard great things about you!”; it felt incredible. 

But around 5-6 months in, I started sliding back into my old mix of bad habits and negative headspace due to:

* Making mistakes and my manager having an outsized reaction
* Small teams leading to 24/7 on-call rotas every few weeks
* Covid-19 pandemic
* A very small bonus (\~5% of a low base salary) despite huge firm profits - I’m ashamed to admit how much this threw my motivation off
* A cycle of poor project estimation skills → procrastination → last-minute rushed delivery of subpar quality → more mistakes
* A bad breakup
* Family bereavements

I left after a few years to join a 10-20 person algorithmic trading start-up. Here, I went through a similar mix of feeling burned out, procrastinating and getting the bare minimum done at the last minute. There were phases of high motivation and really intense and useful learning but these were exceptions to the rule. I learned a lot but I could’ve learned a ton more if I’d been focused. The firm eventually made big losses and had to shut down, and I was suddenly out of a job.

After that, I went into overdrive - \~50 interviews in \~6 weeks, landed 4 offers, including one from a top-tier, lean, highly selective quant trading firm. They almost quadrupled my previous total comp. The people are brilliant, kind, and professional. It’s easily the best work environment I’ve ever seen. It’s the first time in my life I set out to get something and I actually ended up getting the thing I wanted instead of something a few rungs below what I wanted, and it felt unbelievable.

**But now I’m slipping again.** Same habits: procrastinating (reading news, tech blogs, Instagram, anything but work), doing things last minute (leading to subpar PRs with multiple review cycles), and missing growth opportunities. I feel like the dumbest person in the room - others around me are technically sharper, know more about quant trading, computer science, maths and come across as more “complete” engineers.

My manager and team are super supportive and give me a lot of leeway, trusting me to work and treating me like an adult, and I feel like I’m letting them down and breaking their trust.

After switching jobs a few times, I really want to stay and grow at my current place for the next 5-10 years. If everything else stays as good as it is (culture, pay, work, profits), the only reason this job might not work out is *me and my habits,* and that terrifies me. If this gets worse, the effect of this would spill over and hurt my family too. When I’m not productive at work I end up working in the evenings/over the weekend - very avoidable if I had focused at the right time.

Recently, I feel people catching on, i.e. in meetings for a project I’m supposed to build on my own and I often find it hard to discuss low-level details about networking or multithreading in detail when designing a program from scratch. At my current place and the last few jobs, I've worked with people who, like me, didn’t come from a CS background and were still amazing at designing low-level systems, discussing things at the operating system level, knowledgeable about networking etc. and I’m worried that my long-term procrastination habit has meant I’ve fallen behind, especially when I come up with subpar abstractions for large pieces of work. My recent feedback mentioned I’m very detail oriented and good at BAU-style work but my ability to build things from scratch with an optimal architecture and meet a deadline isn’t what is expected from a senior engineer. People think I’m slow at delivering but it’s because my brain is rotting most of the time.

There *are* bursts where I’m focused and in flow mode and I feel great after these, learn things and finish my work but this isn’t very often (one or twice a month, maybe).

With the rise of AI tools in SWE, I feel even more at risk. To stay valuable, I *have* to grow technically and become someone AI can’t easily replace.

I *know* I’m capable of much better if I just learn to apply myself systematically, like a lot of people in my field do. I’m surrounded by people who work like machines (in a good way), great at context switching and genuinely fun to be around too. 

Has anyone gone through a similar experience and managed to break this cycle? Are there things I can try to become a more focused person and a better software engineer?

*Things I’ve tried include:*

* CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) - didn’t help much though
* Meditation - I think this over a few months helped the most and so I’m trying to get back into the habit again
* Pomodoro method
* [Eat the frog](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog) method
* Deleting Instagram, Twitter, Thread etc. from my phone - I always find something else to be distracted by

So, I guess I should feel grateful, finding something better feels unrealistic, since I’m already lucky to be working as a junior in cybersecurity.

I’ve got my life in order and the only thing I want to focus on now is my career, but I don’t know how. I already did Sec+ and Net+, but they didn’t improve my position or help me get interviews for higher-paid jobs. So, what’s the point of certifications? Maybe CISSP? But honestly, I don’t even feel like certifications are that highly valued in France.

1naaddf,Switched careers to QA Engineer from sociology degree now looking to go back to school. Bachelors or masters a better fit?,"Hey folks I'm looking for some advice on whether another bachelors or going straight to a CS masters would be best. 

For some background I originally did an undergrad for sociology and rhetoric and worked many years in labor organizing. I then did a coding bootcamp app academy ( dont recommend it anymore though) to be exact and got into a job as a QA Engineer I've moved up a bit  in my company and am now in a more QAE supervisory role but am looking to transition to software engineering and also get a better core understanding of concepts I lack . I also noticed I'm not really able to apply to many jobs including govt jobs that require a bachelors in cs or other stem field. Seeing as how bad the market is I want to be able to have options if this current job were to not work out.

Bachelors or masters a better fit? Hey folks I'm looking for some advice on whether another bachelors or going straight to a CS masters would be best. 

For some background I originally did an undergrad for sociology and rhetoric and worked many years in labor organizing. I then did a coding bootcamp app academy ( dont recommend it anymore though) to be exact and got into a job as a QA Engineer I've moved up a bit  in my company and am now in a more QAE supervisory role but am looking to transition to software engineering and also get a better core understanding of concepts I lack . I also noticed I'm not really able to apply to many jobs including govt jobs that require a bachelors in cs or other stem field. Seeing as how bad the market is I want to be able to have options if this current job were to not work out.

1na2wdl,Career Dilemma: Stay in India and grind vs Move Abroad,"Hi folks,

A bit of background about myself

Completed my bachelors in CSE at 2023 in a Tier 2 college, got placed in campus at a leading FinTech company with a competitive package. Recently made a switch to a data analytics platform company working as a Backend/DevOps engineer(current package around 30LPA in-hand).

I have an outstanding personal loan of around 15,00,000 to be settled within 4 years(will try to repay within the next 2 years).

Now I had been evaluating my next career options, which are

Stay in India and grind(and possibly land package north of Rs50LPA within the next 2 years)

Get a job abroad applying from India (The most lucrative option, but I'm not sure about the practicality. Had been thinking about countries like Germany, UAE or Singapore but I'm anxious about the job market.)

I’m a fresher. I completed engineering in a different branch, then did a DevOps course and switched to IT. Last year I got a job in a startup, but I feel like my boss is constantly playing mind games with me.

The company culture is really shady. Some people in developed countries (let’s call them A) create fake experience documents showing 8+ years of experience. Since they don’t actually know the work, they reach out to agencies, and those agencies contact my startup. My boss then hires freshers like me, tells us to remotely take control of the client’s laptop via Zoom/other tools, complete tasks, and even pretend to be A on MS Teams.

We never get any real training in DevOps, security, or other fields, yet my boss takes on projects in those areas and expects us to deliver. When I confronted him about it, he just ignored me. We’re supposed to have weekends off, but he pressures us to work weekends too, saying it will “balance out” later.

On top of that, we have to use our personal laptops for all client work (no company laptop provided), which puts sensitive client data at risk. If projects slow down, my boss cuts our salary, and if new ones come in, he increases it again.

This is mentally draining me. I’m in a financial crisis right now, so quitting feels hard—but I also can’t take it anymore.

1n7xtgt,"Background check stuck after a month with FADV – international education issue (EV tech company, Bay Area)","Hello, I am having a situation and hoping to get advice.

Since being laid off in 2024 March , I have applied and gone through multiple and countless interviews for software engineer roles and jobs, with multiple resume tweaks, multiple technical rounds and system design questions. As soon as I finally land a role and sign the documents and got told I was the top candidate with the highest bar and everyone loves me. To getting pushed for a sign up bonus just for them and relocating assistance and also confirming the verbal offer letter and signing the offer letter already before a one long month, and weeks background check to just get this now?

The background check for my new role has taken around a month (a bit over, actually). It’s with a tech company in the EV industry based in the Bay Area, California.

We had originally spoken before and clarified about my B.S. degree — I explained that I had attended university but never finished, and they were okay with that. I schooled in Central Africa for my secondary school, so the real hassle has been the international verification for my high school diploma.

I’ve been going back and forth with FADV until they finally closed the case on August 31. This took one month and weeks just Because they were thing to verify my international education and I have never had this problem before not with any of my jobs I have had my background check with .Everything on my background check was marked as Pass except my education for my high school in Cameroon, which first showed as Decisional and then later the letter said Fail.

I have emailed my two recruiters multiple times during this process, but I have only gotten three responses in total: 1. Asking me to verify my B.S. (I explained and clarified that I attended but did not graduate). Around aug 12 2. The following week, telling me “I’ll let you know if there is any movement.” Like Aug 19 3. Then last week, saying the offer is contingent upon the background check being cleared. The week before Labor Day weekend

I emailed back on the day after Labor Day, Tuesday saying that the background check was closed, but received no response. I followed up again today — still no response.

Instead, I got an automated pre-adverse action letter from FADV on Wednesday that is today. I called them, and they said the only thing they couldn’t verify was my secondary school. This is a school that’s over 150 years old, in a third world country in Central Africa. I had been proactive: I contacted the institution myself, got the principal and secretary to reply, and forwarded their emails to FADV multiple times. But FADV told me it wasn’t from a credible domain name — the school uses Gmail, not a custom domain.

When I called FADV, they told me they didn’t know why it got flagged, but they would email their verification team and get back to me in 1–2 business days.

For the record, I have clarified with HR multiple times about my education and secondary school. I also have no criminal history or any other issues.

I even emailed back with all clarifying answers and documentation once more, but no response. Out of options, I found another recruiter (whose name was on the pre-adverse action letter) and emailed him. He got back to me within hours, but said he does not adjudicate background checks. He cc’d my recruiter after I sent him all the documents too.

At this point I am confused and don’t know what the next steps are. I feel left in the dark. Has anybody else gone through something similar with FADV or with international education verification? What should I expect after a pre-adverse action letter like this? Is there anything more I can do, or do I just wait?

Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I’m a mid-level software engineer with \~4 years of experience, mostly in backend systems and distributed services.   
  
I recently went through a full-cycle interview process with a FAANG company that lasted about 6 months (yes, really). Throughout the process, the communication was consistent — no ghosting, regular updates. I cleared the phone screen, coding rounds, system design, behavioral — everything. Went on to team Match proceess and Got positive signals all the way to the hiring committee, only to be rejected at the final step.

It was a tough pill to swallow, especially after investing so much time and energy.   
  
Now I am refining my approach, and now I’m back to Square 1 in active job search mode.

Instead of asking about prep (I’ve got that covered), I want to **focus on job search strategy** — specifically:

I’ve been applying mostly through company career pages and but I feel like I’m not getting enough traction despite solid experience and projects. I suspect my *outreach strategy* might be the bottleneck.

So I’d love to hear from you:

👉 What changes did you make that led to more calls or recruiter responses?

# Build the AI that builds teams

Mercor trains large-scale models that predict on-the-job performance more accurately than any human interview. Our platform already powers hiring at top AI labs, and we scaled from $1M to $100M ARR in 11 months — making us the fastest-growing AI startup on record.

# What you’ll do

In your first year you’ll ship analyses and experiments that move core product metrics—match quality, time-to-hire, candidate experience, and revenue. You’ll:

* Define north-star and feature-level metrics for our ranking, interview analytics, and payouts systems.
* Design/run A/B tests and quasi-experiments; turn results into product decisions the same week.
* Build source-of-truth dashboards and lightweight data models so teams can self-serve answers.
* Instrument events with engineers; improve data quality and latency from ingestion to insight.
* Prototype quick models (from baselines to gradient boosting) to improve matching and scoring.
* Help evaluate LLM-powered agents: design rubrics, human-in-the-loop studies, and guardrail canaries.

# You’ll thrive here if

You have solid fundamentals (statistics, SQL, Python) and projects you’re proud to demo. You iterate fast—frame the question, test, and ship in days—and care as much about clarity of communication as you do about p-values. Curiosity about LLM evaluation, retrieval, and ranking is a bonus; you’ll learn alongside folks who’ve shipped at Jane Street, Citadel, D.E. Shaw, Databricks, Stripe, and Google.

# Qualifications

* 0–2 years in data science/analytics or similar; BS/BA in a quantitative field (or equivalent work).
* Strong SQL; Python for analysis; comfort with experiment design and causal thinking.
* Communicates crisply with engineers, PMs, and leadership; turns analysis into action.
* Nice-to-haves: dbt, dashboarding (Hex/Mode/Looker), marketplace or search/recommendation metrics, LLM/agent evaluation.

# Perks

* Meaningful equity
* $20K relocation bonus
* $10K housing bonus
* $1K/month food stipend
* Equinox membership

1n6q3rh,cybersec student but leaning towards AI/ML — need clarity on career & fresher salaries,"Hey folks,  
I’m a [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) Cyber Security student in 5th sem. Honestly, I chose this branch without much thought… just went with the flow, kept my CGPA decent, and picked up some basics here and there.

Over time, I’ve dabbled in cloud, backend, and cybersecurity — but I find myself more *drawn towards AI/ML*. I’ve done some beginner-level stuff in ML, understand the basics, and I actually enjoy learning it more than the rest. The only problem is I don’t have a clear roadmap on how to properly get into the AI/ML field.

My doubts:

* As a fresher in India, what kind of salaries can I realistically expect in AI/ML vs something like backend/cloud vs sticking to cybersecurity?

I’m a [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) Cyber Security student in 5th sem. Honestly, I chose this branch without much thought… just went with the flow, kept my CGPA decent, and picked up some basics here and there.

Over time, I’ve dabbled in cloud, backend, and cybersecurity — but I find myself more *drawn towards AI/ML*. I’ve done some beginner-level stuff in ML, understand the basics, and I actually enjoy learning it more than the rest. The only problem is I don’t have a clear roadmap on how to properly get into the AI/ML field.

My doubts:

* As a fresher in India, what kind of salaries can I realistically expect in AI/ML vs something like backend/cloud vs sticking to cybersecurity?
* What’s the best way to break into AI/ML from a non-core background (cybersec student, but decent coding skills)?

Hi everyone,
I’m a 3rd year Computer Science student, and I’ve recently found myself juggling multiple job opportunities. I really need some advice on what path makes the most sense for me long-term.

Here’s my situation:

Job 1 (PHP Developer)

Pay: ₹7k/month

Flexible timings, 6 days/week

No national holiday off

Already worked 3 months here, but they haven’t paid me properly (they delay and don’t pay the full amount).


Job 2 (MERN Stack Developer)

Pay: ₹15k/month

8 hours/day, 5 days/week

National holidays off

Just joined on 1st September.


Job 3 (Tech Consultant & Data Analysis, part-time)

20 hours/week

Paid by work (not fixed salary, depends on deliverables)

Tech stack: SQL + some development

Interview went well, they asked me to contact them on 1st September.



I’m confused about what I should do:

The PHP job already looks unreliable because of the payment issues.

The MERN stack job pays better and feels more stable, but it’s full-time and may be tough alongside studies.

The consultant job is part-time and could give me good experience in SQL + analysis, but not sure about pay consistency.


As a student, which job (or combination) do you think would benefit me the most in terms of career growth, learning, and financial stability?

1n4l8rs,Transitioning from Web Dev to Data Science/ML — Need Advice on Projects & Open Source Contributions,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to get some outside perspective on something that’s been on my mind.

At the start of 2025, I only really understood CNNs. Fast forward eight months, and I’ve studied RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and Bidirectional RNNs. Right now, I’m staring down Transformers, which feel like my “Dr. Doom boss fight” (I’m a huge Fantastic Four fan, so you can imagine the hype).

Here’s the situation:

* I work full-time as a software engineer (more web-dev leaning, honestly) at a startup on probation.
* On weekends, I study deep learning. Since I take detailed notes on every formula and diagram, my Transformer study arc is going to take me 4–6 months to finish.
* In my web dev journey, my personal projects weren’t deployed, and honestly, no one cared about them. This time, I want to do it differently.

**My concerns:**

1. I don’t just want personal “toy” ML projects that sit in a GitHub repo and go nowhere.
2. I want to contribute to open source in ML, but I’ve struggled. I looked into scikit-learn and PyTorch, but I couldn’t really find beginner-level issues. A lot of them seemed advanced, and the ones labeled “good first issue” were sparse or inactive. It feels like I’m just waiting for something beginner-friendly to open up, and it’s confusing.
3. I want to eventually transition into a data science or ML engineering role, but I’m not sure what projects actually stand out.

**My ask:**  
For those of you who’ve made this transition (or who are hiring in DS/ML), what *kinds* of projects or contributions really stand out?

* Should I focus on Kaggle first, deployed apps, or keep hunting open source repos?
* How do I get started contributing if the big repos like PyTorch/sklearn feel overwhelming?
* What would make my portfolio look different from just “another GitHub repo with a sentiment analysis model”?

Any advice or pointers would mean a lot.

1n3dsp1,Do you need a CS Degree to get a job?,I've been in college for a few years now getting my education degree and I'm due to graduate this December. I've always had a passion for CS as well but never considered it as a career choice however; I'm even less confident in the longevity of a teaching career. I'm working on projects and taking a CS 1050 class currently as an elective and I love it. The reason I'm asking this question is because I would need to go to school for another 2 1/2 years to get my CS Degree but I'm not sure if its completely worth it. Do companies care if you have a CS degree or just that you have a degree? If I can prove that I know my sh\*t and show projects that support that does the degree really matter?

1n3defu,Career Advice,"Hey everyone, I’m a 20-year-old Indian Muslim girl in my final year of IT engineering, and I’m honestly feeling stuck/confused and just need to vent and maybe get some advice.

So here’s the situation: My family is pretty old-school and thinks 22 is the “ideal” age to get married. I’ve chosen to focus on placements instead, and I’m trying to convince my dad to let me go to Dubai next year for a job. I’m not sure if he’ll agree, but I want to try my best.

The placement scenario at my college isn’t great — barely any companies are coming yet. My plan is:

* By December (winter break), finish skill development in a tech that UAE companies value most.
* During winter break, do a proper software development internship to put my skills to use.
* Build more projects, gain experience, strengthen my resume, and grow my online presence and professional connections.
* Apply to companies in Dubai, Qatar, etc., and hopefully land a job in the next 4–5 months.

The problem: my graduation will be in July 2026, and I’m not sure if companies will hire me abroad before I have my degree. Some people suggest I first work 1–2 years in India before trying to go abroad. But honestly, I really want some real world exposure before getting married. I want to travel. I want to learn about myself. Explore myself. I am a kid please. If I stay in India, I feel like I’ll be married right after graduation. Going abroad could at least delay that by 2–3 years.

On top of that, my parents sometimes say things like, “If both sisters go abroad, who will take care of us?” When I say they could come with us, they say it’s impossible to leave the rest of the family. It actually makes me guilty thinking about that. I genuinely feel like I’d be much safer in Dubai than in India, but convincing them is a whole different challenge.

I don’t really know what to do — stay in India, try to gain work experience first, or push for going abroad ASAP?

1n2i8lw,Got a full-stack offer (React + Java) with 30–40% hike but 6-day WFO + hustle culture — should I take it?,"Hey folks,

Need some outside perspective here.

Current job

2.5 YOE frontend dev (React, Next, TS, Tailwind).

Current company is a startup → very few projects for the past year, headcount slowly reducing, increments/bonuses delayed. Although doesn't seem myself in near future layoffs.

But workload is low, hours are chill (10–6, 5 days, 3 WFO → may soon become 1).

Not wasting time either: currently prepping for AWS Solutions Architect exam (target ~2 months), and if I land a healthier work culture job I’m planning to do BITS WILP MTech in Cloud later this year (which itself is hectic).
Also applying extensively to land a suitable job in React/Mern stack.

New offer

Role: Full-stack (React + Java/Spring Boot). They said I’ll start with frontend but eventually move into full-stack.

Team: ~10–12 devs (IIT/DTU backgrounds). Cofounder is hands-on, stresses “work hard, hustle culture.”

Work culture: 6-day WFO (Sat = weekly reviews, Mon = sprint planning, limited WFH).

3-month notice period (negotiable depending on dependency).
They keep on saying thst wanna have a long term association, although I don't plan staying here for too long, as need to grow in career.

Salary: ~30–40% hike. Mentioned ESOPs too, but since the company isn’t listed I’m skeptical about liquidity.

Company: WorldRef (B2B industrial sourcing marketplace). Small, bootstrapped.


Concerns

I don’t mind hustle culture as long as expectations are realistic. What worries me is the cofounder already talking about letting go of a good dev because he “wasn’t up to the mark.”

With my mother’s health, I might need occasional trips home (4–5 hrs away). Unsure if they’ll be flexible.

Backend (Java) is new territory for me — I want to learn, but don’t want to be thrown in at deep end with IIT grads and then judged unfairly.

If it was a React only profile, then it wouldn't be any problem though.

ESOPs without clear terms = feels like bait.

Long-term I don’t wanna lose my current stable (though stagnant) job in the hope of a better one that could go south if culture/expectations are toxic.



---

TL;DR: Current job = low workload but unstable startup. Offer = 30–40% hike, full-stack growth, IIT team, but 6-day hustle culture, strict founder, vague ESOPs, high expectations. I don’t mind hustling, but not at the cost of unrealistic pressure or losing flexibility (esp. with family + study plans). Should I risk it or wait for a healthier culture job while keep on upskilling myself (slowly but surely)?

1n0gwtw,Advice on Pivoting to Quant Dev,"Hi I am a SWE with 7 YoE and currently trying to apply for Quant Dev roles.

Here’s some of my backgrounds:
My daily driver is Python. Have done C/C++ in the past for embedded software, but very minimal. Have also worked with Numpy and Pandas when I was building a small scale ETL pipeline, but I don’t use it very often now. Most of my tasks nowadays involve delivering small scale webapps for internal use, mostly with Flask+MySQL+Vue (will occasionally work with htmx).

Recently, I’ve been feeling rather unmotivated with work as I don’t feel like I’m learning as much as I used to. I also felt too comfortable with my current job as I find my daily tasks no longer as challenging as they used to feel. Had some discussions with my manager, and we both agreed that the difficulty/complexity of the products we deliver won’t really get that much higher, given the nature of our team (we develop in-house tools for our engineers) and our budget restrictions (we don’t even host our webapps on cloud, just a single workstation to host all our webapps).

So I have decided to challenge myself to apply to a new significantly more challenging role. I heard (from friends and online forums) quant dev is one such role, and I’d like to try to pivot there. However, I am not exactly sure how to break into that role, given that I am currently not in finance (let alone trading) and has no idea what skills and knowledge is valued in the space. I tried applying directly to some quant shops (thru their own careers page), but I’ve gotten only 1 interview (which I failed anyway) so far.

As such, I’d greatly appreciate any tips/pointers on how to break into the quant dev role. It can be anything from what is the best way to apply/send my resume, what skills/knowledge are needed and how can I best acquire them, or even small useful interview tips.",2,1.0,0,2025-08-26 12:11:11,Warm-Championship753,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareeradvice/comments/1n0gwtw/advice_on_pivoting_to_quant_dev/,True,0,False,False,12,Tuesday,2025-08-26,2025-08,0.0,0.0,"Advice on Pivoting to Quant Dev Hi I am a SWE with 7 YoE and currently trying to apply for Quant Dev roles.

1my7fnw,How to describe my experience to a potential employer in the winning way?,"Hi all, I'm a pure math student, who got tired of having no clear career opportunities in this area. So I've decided to try myself in industry where I can use some of my skills and obtain some others to dive into more applied research. I'm mostly interested in machine learning and optimization methods and trying to get a related job ASAP, more likely in the sphere related to research and development. I have contacted one company with interesting potential job offers and wish to advance my chances to work there. So one of the leads is interested in my CV and wants to know whether I'm interested in working with applied math, not pure, and whether I have some programming experience. This is a literal part of this question he passed on through the other person: ""possibly this experience is low, at the level of student problems or microtasks, and won't suit for developing X"" (i.e. things they're working on). Can you please advise me what I should answer to this and therefore increase my chances to get this job?   
  
To clarify my current experience and some other aspects: during my bachelor I studied low-level aspects of CS, mostly system programming and parallel computing with C, and a small C project with lexical/grammar analysis for a toy compiler. A very small, mostly absent C++ experience. Also some Python for my diploma (researching some algorithm and viewing its perfomance on plots). So no real project experience of course, since I'm from the academic system and for now officially worked almost nowhere, but really had some low-level experience needed for this work (it's connected with ML/DL and some low-level aspects which help increasing performance of related algorithms). Currently I'm applying for advanced ML/DS courses which can help me to advance my career in this field, but they last for 2 years and I want to get a job right now in order to not waste my time. I also contacted one professor who has one project with applying Reinforcement Learning methods to solving computationally complex combinatorial problems, so that could also increase my skills for many research areas of ML + I'm also interested in RL problems myself. I've also recently encountered some interesting challenges, such as studying current scientific progress regarding optimizing data preparation for neural networks, read papers about this and so on; also some research about RL applications in retail business (like dynamic pricing) and tried to solve one interesting combinatorial optimization problem which allowed me to learn many algorithms like GA, local search, beam search and so on. Currently I'm learning Python and its ML-related libraries, algorithms and applied math which can help me in ML and related areas.

1mwz3m0,4 YOE Java dev (Vert.x + Postgres) — Should I focus on Spring Boot + System Design or pivot given AI trends?,"I’ve been working as a Software Engineer (SDE) for the last 4 years, mainly with Java (Vert.x), Postgres, and some Python scripting. Now I’m planning to switch jobs.

The challenge is that most JDs I see heavily emphasize Spring Boot and System Design. My plan right now is to:

1. Learn Spring Boot from scratch.

2. Move on to System Design.

3. Parallelly keep practicing DSA.

My end goal is to land a better role, ideally with WFH flexibility.

Here’s my dilemma: with the rapid rise of AI/automation, I’m wondering if investing time in Spring Boot + System Design is still the right bet for my career, or if I should focus on other areas (like data, cloud, or AI-adjacent fields) that might be more future-proof.

For context: I don’t find coding “exciting” anymore, but I do want to switch into a stable role and keep my options open for the future.

I’ve been working as a Software Engineer (SDE) for the last 4 years, mainly with Java (Vert.x), Postgres, and some Python scripting. Now I’m planning to switch jobs.

The challenge is that most JDs I see heavily emphasize Spring Boot and System Design. My plan right now is to:

1. Learn Spring Boot from scratch.

2. Move on to System Design.

3. Parallelly keep practicing DSA.

My end goal is to land a better role, ideally with WFH flexibility.

1mtt4fh,Rails Dev (2.5 YOE) Seeking Advice: FastAPI vs. Go for Next Backend Stack?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer with about 2.5 years of professional experience. I'm very backend-focused and, while I enjoy Rails, I'm ready to learn something new to expand my skills and eventually switch my primary stack.

I've done some research and narrowed my choices down to two popular options: **Python with FastAPI** or **Go (Golang)**.

My main priorities for choosing are:

* **Job Prospects:** How does the market look for each? Are they for different types of backend jobs?
* **Future Demand:** Which do you see having more longevity or growth in the next 5-10 years?
* **Learning Curve (for a Rails dev):** As someone coming from the ""magic"" of Rails and a dynamic language like Ruby, what will the learning curve really feel like?

Here's my current understanding, and I'd love for you to correct or add to it:

* **FastAPI (Python):** Seems like a smoother transition. Python is syntactically similar to Ruby, and I'd be moving from one dynamic language to another. I know it's incredibly popular in the AI/ML space for serving models, which is a huge plus for future demand. The development speed seems high, but it's a micro-framework, so I'd have to get used to less ""batteries-included"" than Rails.
* **Go (Golang):** Seems like a bigger (but potentially more rewarding) leap. The main draws for me are its raw performance, incredible concurrency model, and the simplicity of deploying a single binary. However, I'm anticipating a steep learning curve with static typing, explicit error handling (if err != nil), and a different concurrency paradigm. I see it mentioned constantly for infrastructure, DevOps, and high-performance microservices.

**My Questions for the Community:**

1. For those who have worked with either (or both!), what are the day-to-day trade-offs that aren't obvious from reading documentation?
2. From a Rails background, what ""blind spot"" or ""gotcha"" should I be aware of when learning either of these? (e.g., ORM differences, handling background jobs, community/library support).
3. If your goal was to be job-ready for a high-quality backend role in the next 6-9 months, which path would you personally take and why?

I am doing an engineering and commerce double degree, my first year of engineering is a common year so students get to try out different specialisations to see which one they like. I had not known what eng I liked most until recently I think I like coding!

1msmwzb,Toxic employer refusing relieving letter — will it affect MNC background check?,"Hi everyone,

I worked in a startup for about 1 year and 9 months. The environment was extremely toxic — I had to work 12+ hours a day, including Saturdays and Sundays.

In January, I met with an accident while going to the office. In fact, the company itself took me to the hospital and admitted me. But even then, their attitude was: “take how many days you want, but you must come back to office only.”

Due to my injury, I was not in a condition to travel or work from the office. I even requested them for a work-from-home option, but they flatly refused. I had no choice but to resign.

When I resigned, my manager replied that they were accepting it due to my “lack of commitment to work.” From what I’ve seen, he has done this with many people who leave, since the company makes good profit from clients and doesn’t want to lose resources once they join.

Now, because I couldn’t serve the notice period, they are refusing to give me a relieving/experience letter.

The thing is, I do have all other supporting documents:

Offer letter

Payslips

Bank statements (salary credits)

Resignation email + their reply

Medical certificate from the accident

I later worked in another company that gave me proper documentation when I left. Now I’ve received an offer from an MNC, and I’m worried about background verification because I don’t have the relieving letter from this toxic employer.

So, I graduated from high school in June 2019. In September 2019, I began a general programming community college diploma. I failed two or three courses. Then, in the winter 2020 semester, I ended up dropping down to two courses, and I think I only passed one of those two courses. Then, I switched to a Web Development Program starting in September 2020. I failed a few courses during my time in that program and was eventually put on academic probation from, I believe, the beginning of May 2022 until the end of April 2023. From approximately April 2022 until August 2023, I was sort of trying to self-teach coding and trying to get a job that way. It didn't work out.

In terms of work, I worked in a call center for a few weeks in July/August 2019. I worked at a hotel for about a month until I got fired in August/September 2021. I worked at an Amazon warehouse for a few weeks in the fall of 2022. I worked again in the same Amazon warehouse for a couple of months in the fall of 2023. I've also worked at a couple of jobs for like a day or a few days. And since I've finished high school until approximately mid-May of this year of 2025, I've been getting free money here and there from the government and the community college. And now, I'm pretty much broke getting a tiny bit of money from the government every month as some benefit that I'm just thankful to at least be getting.

In terms of work, I worked in a call center for a few weeks in July/August 2019. I worked at a hotel for about a month until I got fired in August/September 2021. I worked at an Amazon warehouse for a few weeks in the fall of 2022. I worked again in the same Amazon warehouse for a couple of months in the fall of 2023. I've also worked at a couple of jobs for like a day or a few days. And since I've finished high school until approximately mid-May of this year of 2025, I've been getting free money here and there from the government and the community college. And now, I'm pretty much broke getting a tiny bit of money from the government every month as some benefit that I'm just thankful to at least be getting.

What do I do to get into a tech company or some sort of tech career? I don't want to go back to school, ideally. I am interested in React, SpringBoot, Docker, AWS, Python....",61,1824,1886,0.048,0.88,0.072,0.8041,Positive,True,True,True
1mr4j5t,Need guidance to land an AI/ML internship or job – 4th year student with only 2 mid-level projects,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 4th-year engineering student from India, and my situation is a bit unusual.  
Earlier this year, I was unfairly debarred from my college’s placement program, so I’ve decided to find opportunities off-campus.

I’ve shifted my full focus to AI/ML and currently have only 2 basic projects:

* **Resume Ranker Chatbot** – reads resumes (PDF) using PyPDF2 and ranks them using LLaMA via Groq API.
* **Clip Extractor** – extracts short clips from videos based on timestamps and descriptions (currently not deployable due to RAM limits).

I know these are pretty “mid” compared to what’s needed for competitive internships/jobs, so I’m looking for:

1. **A realistic roadmap** to get from here to employable in AI/ML.
2. **Project ideas** that either use an impressive tech stack or have real public adoption.
3. **Tips on networking** in the AI/ML space (finding referrals, active communities, etc.).

My goal is to **land an AI/ML internship or job before 2026**. I’m ready to put in the work, but I don’t want to waste time building irrelevant projects.

If you’ve been in a similar spot or have mentored someone who got hired in AI/ML, I’d really appreciate your advice.

Thanks in advance.

1mr81om,"2024 Grad, 1 Year Gap, 0 Offers  where Do I Even Go From Here?","I completed my master’s around August 2024, so it’s been almost a year now. 2023 and 2024 were just… I don’t know man. I got into a good college recession was there no luck. I gave a lot of interviews. Reached 7th and 8th rounds in some companies....not even Google, but still 7 rounds and still got rejected. Some of the reasons were the stupidest possible. 

I’m not here to complain, but honestly......... I am just tired.

Ghosting is on another level. It is like they can’t even send a basic rejection mail. 

I gave 5 on-site interviews ...followed up and got “we’ll let you know,” and then silence forever. So frustrating.

Right now, Idek what to do. Everyone says the same thing -- keep grinding, getting a job takes time, keep learning, keep moving forward, apply to startups, work for low pay if you have to. I’ve been doing all of that for a year. Still, no luck. Almost everyone I know from my college batch is also jobless right now. So is it the industry? Is the market just that bad? No clue.

My domain is also ridiculously saturated. I know Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices, but companies only want people with 4+ or 5+ years of experience. People keep telling me ----- 

“Do AI, it’s the buzzword right now.” I get it, and I’m not against it, but should I throw away my whole domain just because it’s trendy? I feel like I should incorporate AI into what I already know, not just switch blindly.



But honestly... it’s become repetitive and monotonous. Everywhere online it looks like everybody is getting jobs, building startups, tracking Y Combinator, whatever. I’m not pissed at them i do know that everyone has their own pace ...but for me it’s just hard to navigate now.

And here’s the real kicker ,, I’m almost out of every hiring bracket. 

I’m a 2024 graduate, so 2025/2026 hiring drives won’t even consider me. 

Freshers jobs want people with an internship or 6 months experience I have none. 

Jobs for 0–1 year of experience also reject me because I now have a “1-year gap with no experience.” So yeah, out of that bracket too.



I’ve reached out to so many people on LinkedIn, on remote work platforms, on every global job site I know but well ......no luck. No freelancing gigs, no startups, nothing. Some companies reject for such weird reasons that I can’t even understand what they want anymore.

And I’m not confused, but I’m exhausted. My confidence in interviews is gone. After a year of this you just lose that energy of prepping for DS/Algo interviews, solving LeetCode, memorizing textbook answers. Now if I got an interview tomorrow, I genuinely think I wont make it........not because I can’t do the work, but because I’m just out of touch with the whole process.

If someone hired me, I’d get the job done, no questions. But if they ask me to prove it through 3–4 rounds, I feel like saying, “You know what? Just don’t give me the job, it’s fine.” That’s where my head’s at now.

I never sat idle..I kept learning, did what hands-on work I could at my level. But it’s just getting heavier and heavier to carry this on. And yeah, I’m even willing to do grunt work, the shitty work, if it’s in my domain—Java, Spring Boot, backend. No whining, no complaints. I just need a place to start. But after a year, I still haven’t got that start.

So… for anyone who’s been in my shoes.....any senior who's in the industry ...who knows this , has faced it .....how did you come out of it? What did you do? How did you make things better?

1mr56ix,New CS Grad Working in AI – Want to Sharpen My Coding Skills,"Hey folks,

I’m a recent CS grad with prior data science experience, and I’m currently working on a healthcare AI project while job hunting. My role so far has shifted away from pure data work and into developing AI agents, building ML models, and writing Python code.

Funny thing is, during uni and internships, coding wasn’t my strongest area. But now that I’m in the thick of it, I’ve found I actually enjoy it — so I’m doubling down on learning.

My approach right now:
	•	Reverse-engineering example code from projects
	•	Mapping out the structure and flow before I write my own
	•	Researching libraries, frameworks, and models as needed
	•	Building my own versions from scratch for practice
	•	Leaning on AI coding agents when I hit a gap in my knowledge (e.g., for parts of a transcription app I’m building for a ministry)

I’d like to level up my skills so I can go from “getting things working” to writing clean, efficient, production-ready code.

1mpm7hg,Recent Grad looking for career advice,"Hello all, I just graduated last year from the University of Green Bay and I got a return offer from the company I was interning with and took it. It's a small company and as such our team wears a lot of different hats and does a lot of different types of work. I've touched C++ embedded code, C#, python, NodeJS, built API's, done a little bit of web dev. I also get the opportunity to travel to varies parts of the country for conferences and trade shows. I also do really enjoy the job, we make Arcade games so its pretty fun. The work life balance is also nice and the salary is comfortable around 70K which is pretty good for the area.  I'm super grateful for the opportunity but I've not sure if I should be concerned about how it may affect my future career. I've got good experience but it's mostly building pretty simple arcade games not large scale systems. The area isn't also much of a tech hub, not a ton of other opportunities here. I don't have a strong desire to go for FAANG or crazy busy cities like Boston, Seattle or anything. I'm okay with making a decent salary at a bank or something, I don't need or want the stress the comes with pulling 250K+ salary's at FAANG companies. One of my other concerns is the management feels very...unstructered...I guess for lack of a better term. We don't really follow any SDLC things very closely, our QA process is very loose and not well defined. I'm worried that since the work is so loose that I'm not learning skills that I would need for more structed organizations.

1mox5og,Should I try to jump to big tech once I get promoted to senior or before?,"Some background: I currently work at an F500 company, and have been for about 1.5 years. I recently was promoted to the next level, and it seems as though I’ll be on track to be promoted to the “senior” level within a year (though this is obviously a case of title inflation). My responsibilities currently include:

- writing/ designing user stories for the project my team is working on (though they are reviewed by a staff engineer) 
- requirements gathering from stakeholders 
- designing structure of project/backend service
- completing the user stories myself 
- providing guidance/help to other engineers as a bit of a filter layer between them and our main staff engineer

Ive been told that once I am promoted to a “senior level” I’ll still have pretty much the same responsibilities, which is believable as there are other seniors on my team who are only working on the user stories. 

My issue is that, while I feel some of these responsibilities are demanding of more experience, I will be far from an actual “senior level” a year from now. Should I try to make my jump before I get promoted? Or should I try to jump after I get promoted and try to down level? Or should I try to jump and stay at a senior level?

1mnmo2w,INTERESTED IN A CS CAREER,"This is going to be long and I thank you in advance if you read through to the end!

I want to layout the plan I'm leaning toward and get some advice on it.

The Backstory:

I am going to be 32 this year, female, married with a 1 year old, and plans for another in the next couple years. I went to college straight out of high school but was not ready and had no idea what I wanted to do. I was pressured to go and major hopped until ultimately dropping out after 3 years.

I have been working in a computer based jobs for the past 10 years. Nothing fancy or as in depth as a CS related type of job, but I use a lot of different programs and very much like exploring them and troubleshooting hence leading to my interest in CS.  
I have zero experience with coding, data analytics, or programming and that really scares me but I am very much intrigued and would like to learn.

I initially thought a BS degree but with my current situation and needing to work full time, I know myself and think I would burn out. I know this degree is demanding and then with wanting to add to our family I think pursing a bachelor degree, taking care of a toddler, working full time, and being pregnant/have a newborn would make me spiral and I wouldn't make it the 4 years. Yes, I have help from my partner but he works full time as well and a lot of the time consuming things I would be needing to do only I would be able to do them. Also, if you're a mom, you know no matter how much the kids love dad mom cant be replaced and I don't want to feel like I am neglecting them.

The Plan:

So here is what I am thinking, my current job offers tuition reimbursement and a community college near me offers an associates degree in computer science fully online. So, four semesters and if I keep certain grades it would basically be paid for by my employer entirely. Once I have the degree, work on transitioning into a position that gets me experience. Also, expand our family during this time.

Once ready, not wanting this break to be too long, possibly a few years, going back for my bachelors. The Uni I want to go to offers the bachelors fully online and the community college I plan on going to for the associates, all credits would transfer).

Why I am thinking this is a good idea:

I will get a degree in 2 years (not a bs but still a degree) and build up experience while still expanding our family without the added stress of school ( this is very important to us and on a time limit, thats why I keep bringing it up)

Ill be able then to get my bachelors in 2 years and already have working experiences and most likely know the concentration I want to pursue in the field

I know this is still going to be very hard work, but I think is much more manageable. But still I ask, do you think it is worth my time? I would appreciate any feedback.

1mnizre,"Fresh Graduate AI Engineer Overwhelmed & Unsure How to Stand Out (Need Advice on Skills, Portfolio, and Remote/Freelance Work)","Hey everyone,

I’m a fresh graduate in Software Engineering and Digitalization from Morocco, with several AI-related internships under my belt (RAG systems, NLP, generative AI, computer vision, AI automation, etc.). I’ve built decent-performing projects, but here’s the catch  I often rely heavily on AI coding tools like Claude AI to speed up development.

Lately, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed because:

I’m not confident in my ability to code complex projects completely from scratch without AI assistance.

I’m not sure if this is normal for someone starting out, or if I should focus on learning to do everything manually.

I want to improve my skills and portfolio but I’m unsure what direction to take to actually stand out from other entry-level engineers.

Right now, I’m aiming for:

Remote positions in AI/ML (preferred)

Freelance projects to build more experience and income while job hunting

My current strengths:

Strong AI tech stack (LangChain, HuggingFace, LlamaIndex, PyTorch, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, FastAPI, Flask, AWS, Azure, Neo4j, Pinecone, Elasticsearch, etc.)

Hands-on experience with fine-tuning LLMs, building RAG pipelines, conversational agents, computer vision systems, and deploying to production.

Experience from internships building AI-powered automation, document intelligence, and interview coaching tools.

What I need advice on:

Is it okay at my stage to rely on AI tools for coding, or will that hurt my skills long-term?

Should I invest time now in practicing coding everything from scratch, or keep focusing on building projects (even with AI help)?

What kind of portfolio projects would impress recruiters or clients in AI/ML right now?

For remote roles or freelancing, what’s the best way to find opportunities and prove I can deliver value?

I’d really appreciate any advice from people who’ve been here before  whether you started with shaky coding confidence, relied on AI tools early, or broke into remote/freelance AI work as a fresh graduate.

1mn81dl,"Got an offer from Big Tech, but at a lower level and salary than expected – accept or retry later?","I’m currently a Staff Software Engineer (level 7 in my company’s ladder) at a solid but lesser-known US startup, where I’ve been for 4 years. Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.

Before that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.

Recently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.

The interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.

They gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.

**Salary-wise:**

* Base: \~30% lower than my current salary.
* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.

I realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.

In comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).

So I’m torn:

* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.
* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.

I’ve been grinding for the past 4 months to switch from my current org to an SDE 2 Backend role. My stack is Java + Spring Boot, and I’ve been deep-diving into interview prep.

I’ve given quite a few interviews now, and honestly… most of the rejections have been in LLD rounds and Java internals. Every time I think I’m improving, another rejection comes in and it chips away at my confidence.

At this point, I’m finding it harder to stay motivated. I’m still putting in the hours, but the “what if I’m just not good enough?” thoughts keep creeping in. I know others have been through this, so I’m hoping to hear from you:
	•	How did you keep pushing through after multiple rejections?
	•	Any go-to resources or practice methods for LLD and Java internals that actually helped you crack interviews?

I really want to break out of this rut and land the offer, but right now I could use some perspective and encouragement from people who’ve been there.

1mljxbz,UCT vs UKZN for BSc Computer Science,"I'm currently in Gr12 and looking at studying BSc Computer Science next year. I have received conditional offers from both UCT and UKZN but I'm unsure of which to choose and wanted some industry insight.

I am specifically interested in how much the university I attend impacts my job opportunities and career progression, both locally and abroad. My understanding is that practical experience like a GitHub portfolio carries more weight than the university I study at, but I have also been told that I may not be able to get a job overseas with a degree from UKZN.

I'd also like to better understand if studying at UKZN could disadvantage me when applying for jobs compared to if I studied at UCT. Also, could my university choice influence my potential salary? I also understand that your university choice plays a bigger role in your early career and that over time real work experience becomes more important, but how true is this?

I also recently heard that UCT is now offering Artificial Intelligence as its own major alongside the standard Computer Science degree and wanted to know how much of an impact this would have on job opportunities in the future. While I am currently looking at going into Software Development after completing my degree, I also want to keep my options opened for fields like Cyber Security, Robotics and AI.

I am also considering whether to study further and complete an Honours degree after my 3 years of BSc Computer Science, but I'm unsure of how important this is from an industry point of view. I am told that an Honours degree is required for fields like Cyber Security and AI (I assume this was before AI was its own major), is this true? Are there any other fields this applies to? Could an Honours degree also increase my salary, if so in which fields?

I'm also a bit concerned about the possibility of being rejected for being overqualified, is this a something I should be worried about if I pursue Honours or do AI as a major alongside Computer Science?

Also, would doing AI as a major be better than doing an AI course online, such as a 6 month online course from Stellenbosch University?

1ml8ja1,Failed career as a software engineer - what should I do,"Hello. 
I have no idea what’s wrong with me, but I think I failed as a software engineer and as a person in this life and I have no idea, what to do with it. 

I’ve got a bachelor in software engineering in 2016. I started doing internships while still studying at the university. I also tried to obtain a master’s degree, I finished the whole 2-year program, but I didn’t get a degree which I should’ve obtained in 2018. During my studies for master’s degree I also worked full time, 1 year as a software engineer in test, 1 year freelancing and I started a job at the outsource company before moving to another country.

Then I moved to another country (Germany) from my native country and started to work there. And here’s where my misfortune only deepened. I started to work at the outsourcing company, which had a contact with some of the German clients, which did have some messy and old-fashioned software written in Java. I created new features and fixed bugs. Even though I did many things wrong, I think I was still able to do the job. Then 1 year of a bench followed. Then the company’s department in Germany had been closed and I had to change companies.

My next company was very cool and I’ve got great experiences (top product, millions of users) there and successfully built one feature, but I managed to stay there only for a year because I had had a misunderstanding with my bosses. I told them (directly) that in my opinion an experienced programmer HAS to know each and every technology in this world (I really thought this way because of many people who were around me previously and who had authority in my eyes that’s why I followed their opinions) and that I didn’t learn anything at their company. That’s why my bosses said goodbye to me.

Then I got into technical consulting where I had to do client acquisition myself. But even if I’ve got myself the first client, I didn’t manage to stick around the project and was eventually thrown away because I was told that “they needed someone more senior”. What it meant, I didn’t get it, but again I was able to do the job when it came to coding and executing tasks.

The second client also threw me away. I was accused of “staying in product meetings, not saying anything (or contributing) and that the client still had to pay for it”. I only wanted to learn more about the product in order to have more context about the business and/or a system and had no idea what I did wrong. I was thrown away again eventually and this consulting where I was employed said goodbye to me.

Then I managed to find a product company from the local market. It was more or less good and the feedback on my job (again simple coding) was good, but I left for an American startup, because I thought the work at a startup would be more interesting. BUT, after 6 months I was laid off. I was a part of a platform team and built backend and front end tooling for the adjacent teams. Even if I’d successfully build some tools, I was still laid off (along with the 20% of other colleagues tho) and of course nobody told me about the layoff reason. I think they do have some kind of a priority list whom they can lay off if the situation requires this or something…

Then I spent 2 years at a German consulting, 1-year bench included. I was successfully shipping features for the project together with the team of other swe s, but the project has eventually ended and went to the support mode and I wasn’t part of it anymore. This year, the next project came, where I had to go and work with the client’s team. The client (again!) didn’t like me or my way of working or something and eventually threw me away again. I have no idea what exactly they didn’t like, I only know that they mentioned that the “communication style” is improvable and I even asked a colleague how can I improve it and I actually did that (got a feedback from that colleague). And now this consulting also wants me out.

It’s been 10 years, during which I haven’t been anywhere more than 2 years, 2 years is my maximum, because I really just had a very bad luck.

I’m feeling myself as a wasted person, I’m feeling lost and miserable, because my career is miserable and I have no idea what I can do to make it better. I’m not successful as a software engineer for whatever reason and I have no idea which other industry can I join (my life always had something to do with the code since the university) and where I can be successful because apparently I cannot be successful in the software engineering field. I’m really frustrated and pained because of my experiences, because when I see shiny LinkedIns of shiny startup founders, I get jealous and angry. Why am I not that? What did I do wrong? What should’ve I done differently? Please help.

1mljqho,"Career Path Advice – Self-Taught, Switching to Programming","Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some guidance and outside perspective on my situation.

I come from a completely different academic/professional background, but I’ve always had an interest in computer science. That interest really clicked when I took a semester course that included Python for basic data analysis and visualization. Funny thing is it wasn’t the data part that grabbed me, but the programming itself. Alongside math, it was one of the only classes I actually looked forward to.

Over the past year, I’ve been in a phase of uncertainty figuring out what I truly wanted to do. Recently, I committed to learning programming seriously and started with CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P). I’m now in the final week of the course and have enjoyed every bit of it.

In parallel, I’ve enrolled in a full-stack development course that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, MongoDB, and MySQL. My goal is to become job-ready as soon as possible to at least support my living and continue learning.

Here’s where I could use your advice:

1. Given that I don’t have a computer science degree, would pursuing a Master’s (maybe a bridge/foundation program) be a good long-term plan, or is self-learning plus portfolio/projects enough to break into the field?
2. With AI changing the landscape, what skills or technologies should I focus on next to stay relevant in the job market?
3. Any other advice for someone in my situation who’s starting fresh and aiming for their first tech job?

Hello! In advance, thanks for weighing in. 

I am currently a healthcare professional: licensed mental health professional. Before you say, don't come to tech, stay in healthcare, know that mental health care can be incredibly emotionally taxing and I don't want to do it AND raise a child at the same time...too emotionally draining. 

Ok, so I've decided to transition into tech and have an opportunity to get my masters for free. Both of the programs linked above start with an 8 week course on programming fundamentals. I am deciding between the Computer Science masters and an Information Technology masters. I would probably focus in Cybersecurity if I opted for the IT degree. I've checked out similar posts on Reddit and some people say that CS is better because that's usually the degree that people/hiring managers are asking for. On the other hand, it seems like Cloud and Cyber are growing fields and there will be plenty of roles in that. 

One thought I had would be to get the MS CS and take the Comp TIA Security+. I completed the Google Cyber Certificate online and plan to take the CompTIASec+ anyway. I also am kinda interested in backend and have been learning Python. Everyone seems to be saying that hiring managers aren't really hiring junior SEs....so maybe that path is mute. I don't know. I'm open to hearing what folks think and any questions that might be helpful to consider. I acknowledge there are so many senior people struggling to get jobs in the field right now.

1mkuvgg,How Can I Prepare for a Master's/PhD in AI as a CS undergrad working in auto industry?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a CS undergrad grad currently working as a system engineer in the automotive industry. The job is stable and has great work-life balance (which I appreciate a lot), but it’s mostly system maintenance and operations — not much actual development or challenging tech work.

I’ve been feeling a bit anxious lately. With how fast AI is evolving, I feel like I’m falling behind. I majored in computer science, but working in this role, I feel more and more disconnected from the tech I actually want to be part of.

I really care about AI, and I’m trying to catch up in my own time. I study deep learning theory, try running open-source models, and attend online seminars after work. I’m still a beginner, but I enjoy learning, and I’m serious about growing in this field.

Here’s what I’m thinking long-term:

* I want to apply for a Master’s or maybe even a direct PhD program in AI likely in the US or Canada.
* I plan to stay at my current company for a few more years, then take a leave of absence to go back to school full-time.
* I’m okay with studying more, I actually enjoy it and I feel like having a higher degree is becoming more and more important for the kind of work I want to do in the future.

But here’s my problem:

* I don’t have much research experience from undergrad.
* I didn’t do any AI projects back then either — just focused on classes.
* I’m not really sure how to build a strong grad school application from where I am now.

If you were in my shoes, how would you prepare over the next 2–3 years?  
And if I want to aim for a direct PhD, what kind of background or experiences do schools look for in undergrads who get accepted?

I know I’m still figuring things out — I don’t have a specific AI subfield in mind yet — but I’m super motivated to learn, and I’d love to eventually work in a country with a strong tech scene and more cutting-edge opportunities.

For context: I’m not worried about English tests — I’m confident I can get the required TOEFL/GRE scores if needed.

Any advice or personal experiences would really help.

1mhwjn6,Did I made a mistake by chasing my dream?,"I'll try to make it short. 3 years ago, I made the decision to chase my dream and I started a double major in physics and computer science. I had other opportunities, I had (and I still have) an ISTQB certification (cum lauda) and I have about 3 years of experience doing software QA. I had job offers, and I could have taken a devops course too and get a high paying job and make a lot of money. Today I'm about to graduate (only 1 test left in solid state), but I'm not so happy. I feel like I lost. had I chased money and not my dreams, I would probably not have sold my NVDA stock, I would probably have a lot more money, and things would have been easier, but I never cared about money, and it's not like I have financial issues, but it feels like a missed opportunity. Instead, I finish with a degree that feels useless, it seems like no one in the industry cares about it, they care more about experience. I could have had it but I feel that my experience is irrelevant now with how technology changed and AI.

1mh5fys,"My brother was impacted by layoffs, seeking referrals in growth/marketing (product-led tech, India/remote)","Hi everyone,

Posting this with some heaviness.

My brother, who's been in the tech space for over 15 years, was recently let go due to a restructuring. He’s been based in Bangalore, India and has led growth and GTM for a few standout SaaS companies—often behind the scenes, quietly building without much noise.

He’s not one to talk about himself, but I’ve seen the hours, the ownership, the calm way he mentors his teams. Now, for the first time in a long while, he’s actively looking, open to Director/VP/Head of Growth roles at engineering-led, product-focused companies.

A quick snapshot of his background:

* 15+ years in tech marketing, demand gen, GTM
* Has built and led teams across APAC, MENA, and the US
* Deep focus on SaaS, infra, and emerging AI-driven products
* Strong hands-on with performance marketing, ABM, category creation
* Based in Bangalore, India | Open to remote/hybrid | Can join in 3–4 weeks

If you’re hiring or can offer a referral, even just point him in the right direction, I’d be deeply grateful. Happy to share his resume or LinkedIn over DM.

1mgun9j,Passion for Computer Science vs Family Pressure for Medicine — Which Uni Path Is Best for Me,"Hi everyone,
I’m 17, finishing high school, and trying to choose the right university path — but I’m stuck between following my passion (Computer Science/AI) and doing what my mom wants (Medicine). I’ve done a lot of research, and I’d love advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or knows about universities in/near Vienna.

My Passion = Computer Science & AI

I’ve always been more interested in tech, programming, and AI than anything else. It’s something I’d love to spend my life doing. I know it takes work, but I’m actually excited about it. I also feel like CS is a faster path to success than medicine. I could already be working and earning well while my siblings are still in med school.

But my mom really wants me to do Medicine — probably because she’s a dermatologist herself, and it’s a respected job. The thing is: I have no passion for medicine at all, and I don’t want to spend 6+ years on something I don’t enjoy just to make her happy. Still, it’s hard to convince her, and I worry she’ll use the excuse of “distance” or “living costs” to steer me away from CS.

My Situation with Living & Travel

I usually spend time in Vienna, and I have family there and in Slovakia. My idea was to live in Vienna and commute daily to a nearby university in another country if needed — since many of the affordable English CS programs aren’t in Austria.

The issue is:
	•	If a university is too far (like 2+ hours) by train, my mom might not agree.
	•	Even though she could afford it, I think she’ll use the distance or cost as a reason to push me back to medicine.
	•	So I’m trying to find a “safe” CS path near Vienna (or within commuting distance) that’s real and respected — and gives me options later (like a Master’s in AI).

University Options I’m Considering

Here are the ones I researched:
	1.	Masaryk University (Brno, Czechia)
	•	Offers a real Computer Science BSc in English
	•	About 1.5 hours from Vienna — manageable distance
	•	Public university, good reputation, affordable
	•	Application includes motivation letter, maybe an exam
	2.	ELTE University (Budapest, Hungary)
	•	Also offers real Computer Science in English
	•	Cheap tuition, but 3 hours from Vienna (might be too far)
	•	I don’t know how my mom will react to this one
	•	Still unsure if it’s too risky for daily commuting or not
	3.	FH St. Pölten (Austria)
	•	Very close to Vienna (~1 hour by train)
	•	Affordable
	•	BUT programs are more technical/applied — not full CS
	•	I worry it won’t be strong enough for future AI degrees
	4.	CEU (Vienna)
	•	Easiest choice because I’ve lived there before
	•	But the English program is not real Computer Science — it’s “Data Science & Society”
	•	Very expensive
	•	Real CS degree only offered in German, which I don’t speak yet

My Questions
	•	Which of these universities do you think is most respected for Computer Science?
	•	Is CEU worth it even if it’s not full CS? Could it hurt my chances later?
	•	Should I just pick Masaryk and deal with the distance?
	•	Has anyone else here had to go against family pressure (like for medicine) to follow your own passion?
	•	Is Computer Science really as risky as people say? Or is it a stable career?

Extra Info
	•	I don’t currently live in Vienna year-round, but I go there often and have connections
	•	I’m studying for IELTS and SAT right now, so I don’t have time to join programming clubs or internships
	•	I don’t have a laptop at the moment but still want to learn basic Python somehow
	•	I’m seriously worried that if I give in to medicine, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life

If you’ve been through this kind of situation — torn between your dream and your family’s expectations — please tell me how you handled it. Or if you know anything about the strength of these schools, please help me understand what future I might have if I choose any of them.

Thank you so much!

I learned C a good while ago; only the basics and I don't remember much but throughout my degree I have been working a lot with Python for my labs and some CS modules I took. I really enjoy programming but I believe there are some serious skills I should learn before committing to a Masters or a career on it.

I believe in order to have a good base I would need to work on some 'common' small-to-medium projects CS majors do to have on my GitHub as well as obtain some certifications.

Any tips on what to do to build this good base? what are some good certifications/courses to do as an introduction into this world? What projects are a must-have for a portfolio/GitHub?",48,1185,1234,0.019,0.854,0.126,0.9752,Positive,False,False,False
1mebsfb,Aspiring Data Scientist - What real-world/niche project areas does the industry actually value?,"Hey everyone, 👋

I'm currently a college student exploring data science, and I came across a really interesting post where someone shared how their niche project experience (like in the payments/fintech space) attracted great opportunities.

That got me thinking — early on, many of us make generic resumes filled with toy projects or unrelated stuff, without understanding what the industry actually *values*. I don’t want to fall into that trap.

Rather than just doing projects for the sake of ticking a box or passing interviews, I want to build things that are:

* Contributable
* Valuable to the industry
* Maybe even launchable as products
* Hard to replicate or generic

I would love input from software engineers/data scientists/seniors already in the industry:  
What are some real-world domains or niche fields where building projects is actually appreciated or noticed? Things that:

* Companies care about
* Make you stand out in a resume/portfolio
* Have scope for learning and real-world impact

Are there other areas I should know about? Maybe harsh reality that I should be ready for?  
I want to build things that are genuinely useful, solve real problems, and contribute to a specific industry. I believe this will not only make me a better engineer but also keep me passionate and engaged in my work.

I've already built a few basic projects to get hands-on with data science, but now I'm looking to go deeper into a specific domain.

1md63ka,"Do I take the job now, or do a Master’s and build my portfolio first?","Hi everyone,

I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science student at a top Russell Group university (heading into my 3rd year in September) and I could really use some advice from people who’ve been in similar situations.

Here’s my situation:
	•	I’ve been doing well academically (firsts in both years so far).
	•	My first year, I didn’t focus much on internships or side projects.
	•	In second year, I got serious — built some personal projects and landed a paid internship at a tech startup.

The internship has been going really well. My manager’s heavily hinted that the higher-ups are really happy with me and might want to offer me a return full time role after I graduate next year.

Here’s where I’m conflicted:
	•	I’ve enjoyed the internship, but it’s not quite the exact tech niche I picture myself in long-term.
	•	I’ve been seriously considering doing a Master’s. Not because I want to avoid working but I genuinely enjoy studying however I do I think it would help me “level up” later on.

	•	My parents (both Master’s grads) have said their degrees really helped them professionally, and I keep hearing that “everyone has a Bachelor’s now,” which makes me feel like a Master’s could help me stand out.
	•	I’ve also always imagined getting all my education done in one go. I know I could come back to do a Master’s later, but realistically, life happens, priorities shift, and I might never actually do it.
	•	Plus, if I do a Master’s straight after undergrad, that’s another year to build my portfolio: more internships, more work experience, more projects, and (hopefully) a stronger CV when I start applying for roles.
	•	That said, the job market isn’t amazing right now. Part of me feels like I’d be silly to turn down a return offer, even if it’s not the specific role I would want to do because so many grads struggle to land that first job.

So, I feel completely torn:
	•	Do I accept the (likely) return offer, even if the role and location aren’t perfect, and start working straight after uni?
	•	Or do I go for a Master’s, build up my skills and experience even more, and then apply for jobs afterwards ,even if it means letting go of a guaranteed job?

Has anyone else been in this situation — either taking a return offer they weren’t 100% sure about, or turning one down for further study? How did it work out for you?

Would really love to hear your perspectives, advice, or “what I wish I’d done differently” stories.

Hi all,

I recently interviewed with a small startup that says they’re working on a cloud-based computing platform.

It seemed legit on the surface.

	•	A formal-looking Internship Agreement
	•	A Non-Disclosure Agreement
	•	A request for a PDF scan of my legal ID (front and back)

Some points to note:
	•	The internship is unpaid, but the agreement includes a 3-year NDA, full intellectual property assignment, and a 1-year non-compete in a country I don’t reside in.
	•	The company has an active LinkedIn page with team members listed and an Instagram page as well.
	•	Their official website is still under construction.
	•	The company address listed is based in Mexico.
	•	The job was described as backend, but the contract lists mostly frontend-related tasks, which feels like a possible copy-paste error.

I’m unsure if this is just a very early-stage and somewhat disorganized startup, or if there are legitimate reasons to be cautious, like- potential phishing or identity theft.

1mbbve0,Confused Between Software Engineer and Software Developer – Seeking Advice as a 2nd-Year CSE Student,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently a 2nd-year Computer Science student, and I'm expected to graduate in 2028. I'm passionate about coding and building projects, but I'm still a bit confused about my career direction.

One thing that’s been bothering me lately is the distinction between a **software engineer** and a **software developer**. I've come across different opinions—some people say they're basically the same, while others say there's a difference in roles and responsibilities.

Could someone please clarify the difference (if there is any)? Also, based on your experience, which path would you recommend for someone like me who’s still exploring the field?

I'm currently a 2nd-year Computer Science student, and I'm expected to graduate in 2028. I'm passionate about coding and building projects, but I'm still a bit confused about my career direction.

One thing that’s been bothering me lately is the distinction between a **software engineer** and a **software developer**. I've come across different opinions—some people say they're basically the same, while others say there's a difference in roles and responsibilities.

Could someone please clarify the difference (if there is any)? Also, based on your experience, which path would you recommend for someone like me who’s still exploring the field?

Any other career advice or suggestions related to computer science, skill-building, or how to make the most of my college years would also be highly appreciated!

1mba1f0,Is my internship offer a scam,"Summary: I got an unpaid internship offer from a tiny startup; contract looks a bit messy, kinda weird terms, and they want my ID. Their website’s not ready, but they’re on LinkedIn. It might be real… or it might be a scam. I haven’t sent anything yet.



_________________________________________________

Hi all,

I recently interviewed with a small startup that says they’re working on a cloud-based computing platform. During my onboarding meeting (after the interview), they showed me a detailed schema of their product, walked me through parts of their codebase, and explained the tech stack. It seemed legit on the surface.

Shortly after, I received an offer for a Backend Developer Internship. Along with the offer email, they sent:
	•	A formal-looking Internship Agreement
	•	A Non-Disclosure Agreement
	•	A request for a PDF scan of my legal ID (front and back)

Some points to note:
	•	The internship is unpaid, but the agreement includes a 3-year NDA, full intellectual property assignment, and a 1-year non-compete in a country I don’t reside in.
	•	The company has an active LinkedIn page with team members listed and an Instagram page as well.
	•	Their official website is still under construction.
	•	The company address listed is based in Mexico.
	•	The job was described as backend, but the contract lists mostly frontend-related tasks, which feels like a possible copy-paste error.

I’m unsure if this is just a very early-stage and somewhat disorganized startup, or if there are legitimate reasons to be cautious, like- potential phishing or identity theft.

Has anyone experienced something similar? I haven’t signed anything or sent my ID yet. Would appreciate any insights before moving forward.",2,1.0,0,2025-07-28 10:45:46,shadman64,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareeradvice/comments/1mba1f0/is_my_internship_offer_a_scam/,True,0,False,False,10,Monday,2025-07-28,2025-07,0.0,0.0,"Is my internship offer a scam Summary: I got an unpaid internship offer from a tiny startup; contract looks a bit messy, kinda weird terms, and they want my ID.

1mbcgp6,Any advice on trying to pivot into specialized roles from a niche roles and general skills?,"Hi, I'm 25m and I spent almost 2+ years on a really niche job and got layed off around Feb this year. 

For the past few months I was trying to find what should I do after that since the job was really niche, it was hard to find similar job or any job at all. 

Recently I got a job at the start of July. It is quite a generalized job, so I tried to reskill to something like front end dev or data analyst while doing the job. But to be honest, after almost a month, the jobs gets quite draining and time consuming since it requires you to have the time tracker on when you are working (and I feel like I need to fulfill the mandatory hours to get the decent pay). And after like 3 week I was really burnt out, and I cannot catchup to any of the reskill activities I was trying to do. When I finished working, I was really tired to even do anything. 

So I decided to resign, I think I don't have the privilege of time as I need to get my specialized skill path going. 

I still have the severance package from my previous company to keep me going, currently I lived with my parents prior to the lay off, so I can cut down spending much. 

What would you guys do in my shoes? I legit had no one else to talk to, that's why I'm going here. Am I making a mistake by leaving the job? Or should've I stay for the money and build the specialized skill slowly?

Alright my life path is a bit weird it starts in left field, but I promise it becomes CS relevant. Grew up in a food manufacturing family, everyone was some sort of Food Science or Engineering in food. Grew up going to industry shows, summer jobs in food, ect, ect. Also, I am an American, but I went to the international school in Manila for Highschool after my parents split up and my mom got head hunted by an Asian snack food conglomerate. I went back to the states for college, went to Texas A&M for Food Science and Technology, did the cadet corps program, and decided not to commission. Got first job in industry working in manila doing product development and ops, did that a year. Moved to Singapore for another company, was an application scientist that supported technical sales, did that a year and change. Dad got cancer, moved to California to be near him, he survived and is still with us. Got a job working in quality management, did those 5 years became a director, but the food industry, when you work for a big enough company, I don't want to call it toxic, but I wouldn't call it fun. 

Found an opportunity in the Philippines with a friend I grew up with importing food products and trading/installing food equipment B2B (Also got to rekindle things with a girl I did end up marrying). That business had several really good years, until COVID, Ukraine War, and Avian Influenza really fucked it over. Poured out a good amount of money to keep it going but my partner was one of the people that never recovered ""Mentally"" from covid, his marriage fell apart. His main contribution to the business was free use of a warehouse he owned, and he decided he wanted to just rent it, and smoke weed all day instead, so I liquidated my assets and washed my hands of him. 

Then I was going to try and start another business but was low on liquid cash and had bills to pay so my close and very successful friend in iGaming came out of nowhere and said Hey I know your free I have a client looking for someone to manage their Manila office, give it a try. I took the job, it was a UK based company making iGaming software, a start up in year 3. It took some adjustment, I was originally just in charge of the operations and deployments in the back office but I fell in love with the business, I started pitching games to design, learning the ins and outs of commercials, endearing myself to every stakeholder, I learned SQL so I could do metrics, learned to use Athena to work with big data. Now fast forward 3 years, in that time I was promoted from office manager to the Director of Operations for the whole company, this includes Strat planning with the CEO, defining the priorities of development, working with the CTO on Build vs. Buy, supporting sales, onboarding new clients, achieving launch and handing them off to customer success. Was verbally told last week by the CEO he wants to look for someone to take part of my role and move me into a COO position. He didn't say it, but I have gathered this will come with a share package and a time commitment. 

Ok, here is where I need the advice. After nearly 8 months of development, we launched a product this April that is printing money. We initially had 1 client that signed on mid development, since launch several have lined up, with a big boy publicly traded company inviting us to pitch next Thursday. The first company that brought this to the market was bought out by the industry leader within a year. So, I think there is a good likelihood we get acquired in the next few years. My problem is even if I'm COO and am making a good name in the industry I'm still on paper a guy with a BS in Food Science and 5ish years in Tech/Gaming. I am going to do all the leg work to put myself in a good place, but I feel like I need another degree or something to legitimize me. 

I am still living in Manila, I have got a wife and a 3-year-old and I want another one, so doing school full time is out of the question. There is a good business school in the city called AIM (no.14 in Asia) I could consider for an Executive MBA on Fridays and weekends. Looked at Georgia Tech OMSA or OMSCS, thought about Online MBAs in the states but they are freaking expensive for what they are unless I go to LSUS or West Texas A&M because what you pay for is network and I am not really going to get that online. The other issue with an MBA is it still doesn’t give me that Tech “Stamp.” I’ve also just recently noticed WGU, the iGaming industry is dominated by Europeans, I feel like school name matters less to them, just that you have it. I like the idea of the self-paced model; I could hammer out a few degrees from there in the slow months and just do less in the busy ones. I doubt I’ll ever leave tech now, this sounds gross, but I feel like I was born to be a tech bro, but I could pivot from iGaming if it made sense.

I am still living in Manila, I have got a wife and a 3-year-old and I want another one, so doing school full time is out of the question. There is a good business school in the city called AIM (no.14 in Asia) I could consider for an Executive MBA on Fridays and weekends. Looked at Georgia Tech OMSA or OMSCS, thought about Online MBAs in the states but they are freaking expensive for what they are unless I go to LSUS or West Texas A&M because what you pay for is network and I am not really going to get that online. The other issue with an MBA is it still doesn’t give me that Tech “Stamp.” I’ve also just recently noticed WGU, the iGaming industry is dominated by Europeans, I feel like school name matters less to them, just that you have it. I like the idea of the self-paced model; I could hammer out a few degrees from there in the slow months and just do less in the busy ones. I doubt I’ll ever leave tech now, this sounds gross, but I feel like I was born to be a tech bro, but I could pivot from iGaming if it made sense.

1m93lbh,"Seeking Guidance: Preparing for a Role Focused on CRM & API Integrations (Zoho, SAP, Gmail, Shopify, etc.)","
I’ve recently accepted a role at a company where I’ll be responsible for developing and maintaining API integrations between CRM systems and a wide variety of third-party services or at least that’s what I speculate I would do according to the requirements .

To prepare effectively and ensure that I’m delivering value from day one, I’m trying to get a better understanding of what’s involved in this kind of work — both technically and strategically.

Here is a summary of the platforms and tools the job requires integration with:

CRM Platforms:
	•	SAP CRM (used as the enterprise backend)
	•	Zoho CRM (for managing leads, tasks, and email communication)
	•	Potentially a custom-built CRM system

Third-Party Services to Integrate:
	•	Gmail
	•	WhatsApp (possibly through Twilio or Meta’s Cloud API)
	•	Phone call logging (likely via VoIP providers)
	•	Shopify (form submissions and web chat)
	•	WooCommerce (form submissions and web chat)
	•	EMS (Email Marketing Systems like ActiveTrail)
	•	Calendar systems (Google Calendar, etc.)
	•	Google Sheets or internal databases (for logging and reporting)
	•	Social messaging (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Google My Business)
	•	Facebook Ads Manager
	•	Google Ads Manager

What I expect to be doing:
	•	Listening to and processing incoming webhooks (e.g., from Shopify)
	•	Mapping and sending data between systems via REST APIs
	•	Automating workflows such as lead creation, email notifications, and data logging
	•	Managing OAuth2 authentication and tokens
	•	Structuring integrations to be secure, scalable, and maintainable
	•	Potentially building or configuring UI dashboards for workflows and monitoring



I’m looking for advice on the best way to prepare and skill up for this kind of role.

Specifically:
	•	What concepts, tools, or technologies are essential for success in this domain?
	•	Are there any open-source projects or tutorials that you recommend?
	•	What are common pitfalls or challenges when integrating CRM systems with external services?
	•	What frameworks or architectural approaches are considered best practice for handling such integrations?

These are the requirement as they were given to me.

**Level 1** was straightforward—basic frequency counting using hash maps. Quick win.

**Level 2** required prefix sums combined with range-based logic. It wasn’t very complex, but I made a small off by one error and spent longer than I should have debugging it.

**Level 3** was a tough one classic dynamic programming with memoization, but wrapped in a nested structure. It involved counting the number of valid sequences under some rules. I got the recursive logic right but messed up the base cases and failed some hidden tests.

**Level 4** was an advanced graph traversal problem involving cycle detection and shortest path, but with weighted edges and constraints that made Dijkstra or BFS alone insufficient. I barely got through the input parsing before time ran out.

The test wasn’t full of obscure algorithms it leaned more toward simulating real-world problems. But the pressure of time and high stakes makes small bugs and missed edge cases costly.

**One tip:** practice writing clean code fast. I wasted time on boilerplate instead of focusing on correctness. Also, having strong muscle memory for patterns like 2D DP, BFS/DFS on grids, or topological sort really helps when seconds count.

Apple (ML and signal processing in the HID team) - San Diego, ~170k base, 270k RSU, 30k sign on 
Meta (Research Scientist, ML in the off-platform creators team) - Seattle, ~170k base, 350k RSU, 70k sign on 

Apple work would be about ML and non-ML algorithms for touch sensor devices and Meta's work would be about video recommendation. I know there are concerns about job security at Meta but I am wondering if working at Meta would make me more competitive in the tech world moving forward. The team at apple works more on the signal processing side with a little bit of ML while Meta would be more cutting-edge ML heavy. I prioritize WLB but I have heard both companies work you till the wheels fall off. What do you guys think?

1m7i5df,Is now the right time to shift toward software engineering? When can I start applying for junior roles?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working toward a career in QA automation, but after doing more research, I’m considering switching my focus to becoming a software engineer instead—mainly because of the stronger potential for remote work.

I’m currently working full time and in a CS degree program. I start my second class at the end of next month. I already have some experience with Python and automation tools from my QA studies, and I’ve done a few small projects.

The thing is, I’m kind of in a holding pattern at my current job while I wait for a process to finish (should take about a year), so I’m thinking now’s a good time to build up toward SWE roles.

My question is: at what point would I realistically qualify to start applying for entry-level software engineering jobs or internships? Do I need to finish a bunch more CS classes, or can I start applying once I’ve built some strong projects and sharpened my DSA/interview prep?

Would love to hear from others who broke in while still working or early in their degree path.

Thanks!

1m7fzt7,"Should I take a gap year to get co-op experience before graduating? (No internships yet, 4th year SWE student)","I’m going into my fourth and final year of software engineering and I still have NO formal internship or co-op experience. I’ve been applying since second year and haven’t been able to land anything. I do have project experience from school (both solo and group projects), but no actual work experience on my resume.

The job market is absolutely brutal right now, and it’s hard not to feel discouraged. If I can’t even get an internship, how am I supposed to land a full-time SWE role after I graduate?

My school has a co-op designation, but to graduate with it I need 12 months of co-op experience. The only way I can get that now is by either doing a 12-month internship starting this fall, or an 8-month (fall + winter) + 4-month summer internship, which would mean taking a gap year and delaying graduation.

Part of me thinks I NEED this experience just to be competitive after school. But the other part is nervous about taking a whole year off when nothing is guaranteed.

Has anyone here taken a gap year to get experience before graduating? Did it actually help your job search? And how important is it to graduate with “co-op” on your degree in this industry?

1m6pfia,Directions forward after time away,"I've been loosely following/away from the field for some time, and am looking to sharpen my rusty skills/tools and re-establish myself/my career.

I'll try to keep the backstory brief. I have background in biomedical sciences from college days, as well as more recently in software development and data science. My employment history is 5 years of development, some concurrently with the completion of a masters program. I've been out of work for 2 years, taking care of sick family members, intermittently working on data science/development projects, and applying to some jobs, albeit far too infrequently and selectively. While I was let go, my previous employer has made it clear that it was due to financial constraints and not performance, and is very willing to act as a reference for me. I've also been dealing with and trying to resolve my own depression/anxiety, with professional help. I don't think that absolves me of letting things get off track; this post is a part of me trying to right myself.

My past two years have a few projects in various degrees of completion, one paper and potentially another on the way, both data science related. My ideal position would allow me to apply my software/ml background to biomedical sciences, and I have secondary interests in energy forecasting and general software development, especially functional programming. I have a preference for positions that prioritize work-life balance and a mission I resonate with over salary, but also a preference for finding anything that works above that.

My specific questions:  
\- Does anyone have any recommendations for useful tools, job boards, or other assistance when submitting applications?

\- I'm also looking to catch up/review certain topics; programming paradigms, tools, modelling techniques I had learned but not frequently reviewed. I've done some leetcode; is that still a good direction to go, or do you know of other good resources to review/test my knowledge? Any good ways to practice tools like PowerBI/Tableau without spending a ton on licenses?

\- I'm concerned my nontraditional background, in particular a lack of math courses. I know of free courses online, but is it worth the money to get a certificate to build a resume/demonstrate recent engagement? Similarly, I've learned/used a lot of ML at work, in projects, and in class, but lack pieces of paper/accredation. Should I bother going after those?

\- As I mentioned, I've tended towards writing fewer, stronger applications to positions I think I am a good match for; I think I need to be less selective and more productive in getting applications out though. Is it worth it to take the approach of using AI to submit bulk, impersonal applications? I'm frankly quite frustrated by the whole AI bot wars situation with hiring, but whether I'm frustrated won't change the state on the ground, and if it's what I need to do then I'll do it.

1m5xzyk,Need urgent advice with job opportunity,"Hello lads,

I'm a junior backend developer with 2 years of experience living in Ireland and looking for a remote possition. I recently got a job opportunity that I don't fully trust, I'll try to explain the situation and I need your point of view. Might be a bit long but I need to give context, as I don't want to give names.

I applied on LinkedIn and the recruiter contacted me, we made a **first basic interview** and everything went well. It was for a company based in the USA trying to expand to Ireland and the project seemed interesting and related to my previous experience. 

After that I was called for a **second interview, technical this time**, in which I spoke with the one that would be my team leader: he just explained what the project consists of, asked a few basic questions about the technologies I was keen on and that's all, **no technical questions, no code examples,** nothing. I was surprised but I figured not all interviews need to be an in-depth exam.

Today, a week after the interview, **they offer me the job**, telling me I had to start this Wednesday. That's just 2 days from now. I tell them I'm not fully interested because of the kind of tasks that I had to do, as it was just solving bugs on a drag and drop application, no real coding. **They end up saying they might have a possition I could be more interested in**, but that I might be able to start on Wednesday anyway to do the onboarding. Sounds weird to me, but I guess it's something that can happen and if they have another possition available they might as well go with someone more advanced in the hiring process. 

**The company looks real overall**. LinkedIn profile seems real, it's employees seem real, recruiter seems very real (LinkedIn voices and all that). There are reviews on various webs like Glassdoor that, although they are not the best, seem also real. Their website seems a little bit simple and out of date, weird for a software company but somehow beliavable.

Any input here will be greatly appreciated, as I need some different perspectives. Also, any tool or trick to try to verify if this is or is not some kind of scam would be cool.

Years of dreaming - to get into this company only to 
get disappointed .

1m4s13r,Help Me Decide on Next Steps in My Backend Learning Journey,"Hi all,

I'm a self-taught backend developer with 4 years of experience, currently working at a small startup. As you might expect in a startup environment, I wear a lot of hats - handling planning, maintenance, support, stakeholder communication, and coordination with external partners.

Because of this, I haven’t had the chance to fully immerse myself in coding and technical growth, and I feel like I’ve fallen behind in some areas. There are knowledge gaps I’d like to close, especially if I want to stay competitive and grow into a stronger, more seasoned backend developer that is hireable by small to medium-sized companies.

Recently, I started working on side projects to bridge those gaps, but I still feel unsure about the most effective way forward. That’s why I’m turning to the Reddit community for advice.

Here’s a snapshot of my current progress based on the [backend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend?s=687cf314d8402b4cbd89c513) (Gray items are completed, green ones are intentionally skipped, and everything else is pending) that is also attached to this message.

Some additional context:

* My DevOps knowledge is minimal
* I have limited understanding of networking and computer hardware

At this point, I see a few different possible paths I could take:

1. Watch Amazon’s AWS Fundamentals course and pursue a certification to strengthen my DevOps foundation
2. Study a medium-to-large open-source project to learn from real-world design patterns and best practices
3. Build a mid-to-large sized backend project that forces me out of my comfort zone and lets me implement tools and practices I haven’t used before (especially those in the roadmap)
4. Create several small projects, each focused on 1–3 specific topics to deepen understanding in manageable chunks

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Which of these paths do you think is the most valuable? Have any of these approaches worked for you personally? Feel free to suggest other ideas too as I'm open to all input.

1m0pa08,Career Pivot at 38 — How Do I Get Back Into Tech and Stay Relevant?,"Hello beautiful people, I could really use some guidance. I feel stuck right now. I’m currently 38, turning 39 in a few months. Quick backstory: in 2019, I completed a coding boot camp for front-end web development. I worked for a small company for a few months before it shut down, then did some freelance projects, but things didn’t take off the way I hoped. So, I returned to my original trade as a Carpenter.

The truth is, I’ve been over it for a while now. I’m ready to get back into tech. My dream is to work in San Francisco’s Salesforce Tower one day (I’m from SF, CA). But recently, I saw an interview with Salesforce’s CEO, Marc Benioff, discussing how AI is going to transform the company, both in exciting ways and through job cuts in certain roles. Assuming WebDev roles. 

That’s why I’m reaching out to ask for advice. What programming languages or technologies would you recommend I learn right now to break back into tech? If AI is the direction I need to head, I’m willing to dive in. I also have a bit of cybersecurity background and would consider pursuing that too if it makes sense. I’m willing to learn anything right now and do what I need to do to get to where I want. I will make time to achieve my goal.

That’s why I’m reaching out to ask for advice. What programming languages or technologies would you recommend I learn right now to break back into tech? If AI is the direction I need to head, I’m willing to dive in. I also have a bit of cybersecurity background and would consider pursuing that too if it makes sense. I’m willing to learn anything right now and do what I need to do to get to where I want. I will make time to achieve my goal.

At this point in my life, I feel like I’m at a crossroads and unsure which path to take. Any advice, direction, or resources you could share would mean a lot to me, it might genuinely change my life. Thank you in advance ",67,1454,1522,0.023,0.832,0.145,0.987,Positive,False,False,False

I’ve been working hard on improving my Python skills and I’m trying to find a remote job (full-time or part-time, paid in USD). My goal is to get contract work while I continue building more backend skills (Django, FastAPI, DevOps tools, etc.).



So far, I’ve been focusing on:



\- Python

\- SQL

\- pandas

\- BeautifulSoup (bs4)

\- Selenium

\- requests

\- pytest

\- GitHub

\- Are these skills enough to get hired for remote roles in scraping, automation, or basic ETL/data processing?

\- What job titles or keywords should I search for?

\- Any platforms you recommend for someone in my situation?

Hi everyone,
I'm currently a 2nd-year pre-medical student from Abbottabad, Pakistan, and I’m honestly really confused about what to do next. I don’t think I’m cut out to be a doctor – my grades are okay but not outstanding, and to be honest, I don’t even know what my real interests are.

I don’t want to waste time chasing a career path I’m not suited for. I’ve been thinking about options like physiotherapy or other health-related fields that don’t require super high marks or years of study like MBBS.

Does physiotherapy have a good scope in Pakistan? Are there other careers (maybe even outside medicine/biology) that are worth considering for someone like me who isn't sure what they want but still wants a decent future?

* I’ve worked on learning platforms, reporting tools, dashboards, and real-time systems.

1lxt3b2,No clue about finance careers — how can I make big money as a fresher with a CS background?,"Hey all,

I’m a recent CS grad, just started working as a systems engineer at a MAANG company. Honestly, I have zero idea how finance careers work.

The only thing I’ve heard of that pays crazy well (and fits my tech profile) is being a software dev in HFT or quant firms. Beyond that, I don’t even know what roles exist, or how people get into them.

My main goal is simple:
1. Figure out what are the highest paying career paths I can aim for as a fresher (or with 1–2 YOE)
2. And what should I start preparing for this year to have a shot at them.

1lvr4nq,[Career Switch Advice] From Architecture to CS,"
I have a background in architecture (both undergrad & grad) and have been working full-time as an architectural designer in the U.S. The industry has slow growth, long hours, and low pay — even at top firms, hitting $100K+ often takes over 10 years. I don’t want to wait that long.

I’m seriously considering moving into fullstack development. I’ve started learning Python and some front-end basics and really enjoy it.

I’m now exploring CS/AI Master’s programs — ideally:
Online or part-time (so I can keep working)
Affordable
Friendly to non-CS backgrounds
Prepares me well for fullstack roles

⚠️ I’ve already used OPT/STEM, so I’d likely need an F-1 visa if studying full-time — but I’m open to that if it’s worth it.

Would love your thoughts on:
Best CS Master’s programs (online or not)?
Is OMSCS realistic for someone like me?
Is NEU Align worth the time/cost?
Any lesser-known gems?

\-------------  
October 2024 I took on a new role of tech lead in a project I was being onboarded on after working 2.5 years as a developer.

For a bit of context, the project was extremely mismanaged and was being driven into a wall, it was being implemented in technologies that I had little to zero exposure to before, the team was juniors only and none of them had more than 30% of the competences needed for the project, and I wasn't even receiving a raise to match the increase in responsibilities, in my excitement to grow faster and learn more, I said yes to the request to become a tech lead without much thought except that ""there are no bad experiences"", fast-forward 10 months I can see how much of a miscalculation that risk I took was but at the time I didn't know.

By February 2025, I was left burned out to the bone and my mental health got so wrecked I become incapable of keeping up one conversation with anyone in my family without snapping or flipping out, I lost weight, stopped eating and sleeping properly, let alone the theatrical deep dive my performance took at work, and not even therapy was able to help. So I ended up taking a 6 weeks unpaid time off after which I came back as a detached and undriven underperformer.

Now my confidence is wrecked, I'm struggling to reclaim my self respect and my drive to work well in my current role or look for a better role where I may have some hope of switching to a healthier and more rewarding work environment, and I'm just stuck in this limbo.

I just advanced to the final interview loop for Canonical’s \*\*Security Software Engineer (Fast Track)\*\* position.

1. \*\*Software architecture & engineering skills\*\* (1h)  

2. \*\*Linux system skills\*\* (1h)  

3. \*\*Security deep-dive\*\* (1h)



If you interviewed for this role (or a similar security-focused role at Canonical) in the last year, I’d really appreciate any insight on:



\* How technical were the questions? White-board design vs. command-line grilling?  

\* Did they dig into your written take-home exercise / DevSkiller code during the call?  

\* Depth of AppArmor / kernel security questions?  

\* Any curveballs or gotchas you wish you had prepared for?  

\* Recommended prep resources or focus areas (books, blog posts, commands to know by heart)?



For context:  

\* Background in embedded C/C++, ROS2, and Linux networking.  

\* Comfortable with nftables, seccomp, CIS benchmarks.  

\* Brushing up on AppArmor profiles and Ubuntu Livepatch flow.

* **Capgemini** – *Associate Consultant*

* Work environment and support
* Learning and technical growth
* Company culture and project exposure

1ldyxxx,6 months in and the responsibility is weighing on me,"So I started at this company right after college just doing data entry and making barely any money to get by. I tried picking up side jobs to keep me afloat and applying other places with little to no success. It got to the point where I was so bored doing data entry that I essentially carved out a co supervisor role for myself in my department.

Basically a coworker in management found out I went to school for programming and told upper management I would be a good fit. I started in January and picked up very very quickly. Even though I’d been doing data entry for 2 years at this company with zero outside programming except for what I learned in school.

The issue is the work environment is completely toxic (it always has been since I started working here) and the stack is extremely old (ASP WEBFORMS + SSRS). I also now have a junior programmer under me that was supposed to help with my workload but refuses to review his work and has no idea the fundamentals of programming. Both of my senior developers are MIA as one of them is working on AI projects and the other is retiring very soon. I’m trying my hardest to leverage this to make more money (I only currently make 50k in a large city) but they won’t budge. 

Is there anything specifically I should be doing to get out of this situation other than just applying to other jobs?

1lcz7tg,Trilogy Innovations Campus Drive – Unexpectedly Hard Questions,"Hey everyone, I just finished 3rd year of btech in CSE  
So there was a campus drive for **Trilogy Innovations** and I recently appeared for **Round 1 (Coding Round)**. Honestly, the questions felt *very* difficult — I hadn’t come across most of them before, and even now, I can’t seem to find them online except for one.(and none on leetcode). And i have been practicing leetcode,dsa,java,react etc since few months consistently

I’ll be sharing the link to the questions below, but I wanted to say — this round kind of **demotivated** me. I’ve been preparing regularly, but these questions felt like a big jump in difficulty, and it’s left me questioning if my prep was even close to enough.

I’ll be sharing the link to the questions below, but I wanted to say — this round kind of **demotivated** me. I’ve been preparing regularly, but these questions felt like a big jump in difficulty, and it’s left me questioning if my prep was even close to enough.

1ld3sm9,I'm a 2023 CSE grad who shifted to DevOps in 2024. Is a 2-year gap a big problem?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a B.E. CSE 2023 graduate from India. After college, I spent some time exploring UI/UX, but in late 2024 I found a genuine interest in DevOps and Cloud Computing.

Since Aug 2024, I’ve been learning hands-on with tools like Docker, AWS, Jenkins, Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Linux. I’ve also done a 4-month internship working on AWS-based serverless projects.

I know there's a 1.5–2 year gap after graduation, and I’m worried if that will affect my chances of getting an entry-level DevOps/Cloud role.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Does the gap matter much if I can show real skills and projects? Any tips or feedback would be appreciated 🙏

1l6zwm9,Shifted to Web Dev (MERN) After Trying Data Science Seeking Guidance & Tips!,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a bit about my journey and get some advice.

I got into tech not because it’s “booming,” but because I genuinely enjoy coding and problem-solving. Over time, I’ve explored several programming languages — C, C++, Java, Python, and R — and started learning Data Science with pandas and numpy, doing some beginner-level data analysis.

But through that journey, I realized something important: while Data Science is interesting, my true passion is in building things and solving real problems through code. That’s why I’ve shifted my focus to Web Development, specifically the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). Creating websites has always been a dream, and now I feel ready to go all-in.

I know web dev is a saturated field, but I’m not in it for the hype. I’m here to build, learn, and improve.

I’ll skip the part that’s probably been said many times here.

Is it enough to master just one programming language along with Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to get a good placement? Or should I be learning other things too?

Looking back, I regret that decision — I didn’t feel like I got much out of the program.

Luckily, I landed a job as a .NET developer, and I’ve been working as a software dev for the past three years.

Alternatively, I could go the self-taught route — MIT offers a free online CS curriculum, and I’ve looked into that. The downside is that I struggle to stay motivated when I’m not in a structured program.

1iysiuy,Mid-career advice for a Manual QA Engineer,"Hey everyone,

I’m seeking advice for my sister, who has 9+ years of experience in manual QA/testing (software) in the U.S. (she’s an engineer by training). With the rise of AI and automation, she’s considering transitioning into management - specifically into business, product, or business-driven roles.

Her main question is how to build skills that offer immediate value while also supporting long-term career growth.

1itwtiu,"Got an offer from a US startup, but should I renegotiate my salary and equity? Need advice.","Hey everyone,

I need some advice on a job offer I recently received from a US startup. Here’s some context:

I’m currently working as a **full-time consultant** at a Mumbai-India based company as a **full-stack developer**. My **CTC is 4.7 LPA INR** (approximately **34k INR in-hand**), and I work **5 days a week** (with **2 paid holidays monthly**). Things are going okay here, but I recently received an offer from a US startup, which got me excited initially.

The offer is for **12k USD/year** with an **8-9 hour shift** on **5 working days**. Sometimes, I might need to work on Saturdays. After the CTO initially quoted this pay, I accepted the offer excitedly, but after talking with him and understanding the roles and responsibilities, I’m now thinking of renegotiating.

# Key Points:

* **The CTO** mentioned that I’ll be the **second developer** (he’s the first one) in the company. The **CEO** is non-technical and hired the CTO.
* The **CEO has given 5% equity to the CTO** for his role in the company, but when I spoke to the CTO, he **verbally promised me equity and a bonus** if I stick around for a year. However, this was never **written in the offer letter** or anything official — he just said it **verbally on a phone call**.
* CTO was also hired in month of Feb - 2025
* During the interview, the CTO mentioned that he had interviewed around **40-50 people**, and **none of them could complete both frontend and backend tasks** — and I was the only one who could **complete both quickly**.
* My role will involve managing **everything** — cloud, frontend, and backend, which is a lot of responsibility.
* The CTO has also mentioned they will hire only one more intern, apart from me, who will work under me. So in total, there will be **3 people** handling everything.
* Apart from this startup, the CTO also works in **another company**, and he has **around a year of experience** only. He’s Indian but did his graduation in the US and is now working there. Both of us are **2023 passouts**.

# The Situation:

* I have about **1 year 9 months of experience** (excluding internships, around 6 months of internship experience), and this is my **second company**.
* The **equity part** feels a bit unclear to me because the CTO verbally promised it, but nothing is specified in the offer letter or written down.
* Given the workload and responsibility of being the second dev in a startup, I feel like the pay might not be enough.

Now, I’m thinking of asking for **minimum $1500/month** with **1-2% equity**. I believe this is more in line with the role and the responsibility I’ll have to take on.

# Tax Concerns:

One concern I have is the **tax impact**. As we know, if annual pay is **less than 12 lakhs INR**, then we are not required to pay tax. However, if it goes above **12 lakhs**, taxes will apply. The **income tax slabs** are as follows:

* **Up to Rs. 4,00,000** — NIL
* **Rs. 4,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000** — 5%
* **Rs. 8,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000** — 10%
* **Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000** — 15%

If I get **12k USD/year** (approximately **10,39,520 INR**), it would **not** cross the tax threshold. But if I renegotiate for **$1500/month** and he agrees to pay between somewhere 1000 - 1500 USD (which would bring it to **18k USD/year**, around **15,59,285.33 INR**), I might cross the **12 Lakh INR** mark and have to pay taxes. Is this something I should consider when negotiating my salary, or should I take the hit on taxes for the higher salary?

# A few things to consider:

* I don’t currently have any other offers.
* My **current company** has mentioned that they’ll try to match the offer to retain me, but I haven’t committed to anything yet.
* I am negotiating my notice period and wrapping my work fast here so i can join them within 10 days

# My Questions for You:

1. Should I try to **renegotiate the salary** now or wait until I’ve been there for a while and proven myself?
2. How much **equity** is fair to ask for, considering the responsibilities I will have? Is **1-2%** reasonable?
3. Should I be worried about the **lack of written commitment** on the equity part?
4. Is it normal for a **startup to not specify the equity** and bonuses upfront in the offer letter? Or is that something I should definitely get in writing before committing?
5. Should I consider **tax implications** while renegotiating the salary? Is it worth crossing the 12 Lakh INR tax threshold?

I’d love to hear thoughts from others who have worked in startups or have faced a similar situation.

1i2dl38,Advice for master’s degree for software engineer ,"Hi! I (24F) have been working as a software engineer for about 4 years, and I’m looking to get a master’s degree to gain more specialized skills that could help me stand out from the millions of others in the field. 

I am also specifically looking for something that’s not past its peak or could be replaced by AI in the near-to-intermediate future.
I’ve been looking into master’s programs, but nothing has caught my eye.

Some things to take into account:
* I’m looking to specialize in a specific field, so I’m not interested in programs that primarily build on basic software engineering concepts.
* I know for a fact that I don’t want anything related to AI/ML development, cybersecurity, or business. I’ve had some experience with all of these (particularly AI), and I really don’t enjoy them.
* I also have some experience with data science, and I find it somewhat interesting, but I’m worried that the market is already too oversaturated. I liked finding patterns and correlations that could explain behaviors through data.
* I don’t have any experience related to electrical or electronic engineering.
* I’ve never been into robotics or IoT.
* Quantum computing seems very interesting, but I also don’t have a background in physics. I could be willing to learn, but I’m worried it would take several degrees to make any relevant contribution to the field.
* I don’t have experience with bioengineering, and I’ve never been particularly interested in biology.
* I found computer theory interesting when I was in uni, but I am unsure about working in an academic field.
* I love problem-solving and designing complex solutions.
* Unrelated to IT, I love media of all types (music, literature, film, etc.) and fashion. If whatever I choose is creative in any form, that would be a nice bonus.

While my background is mostly in web development, I don’t enjoy front-end work (even though it’s where I’m most skilled). I’ve been exploring different areas, and here’s where I’m at:

* IoT/Embedded – I really love all home automation stuff, I like to see the devices actually ‘working’ and improving everyday life (like e.g. a motion-triggered lights system I built); but I don’t like ‘lower’-level programming (looking at you, C++) and I’m not the best at hardware stuff (even though it’s interesting to me, I just don’t have the manual skills for e.g. soldering)
* Back-end – I really enjoy it and I’m already experienced, especially with C# and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) for Web APIs, but repetitive CRUD work feels uninspiring
* Machine Learning – it’s fascinating the see results, but I don’t like the fact that it’s expensive (meaning that I can’t just casually run some big model on a RPi, and cloud models aren’t free either)

I started from scratch like learning what a neuron is, Building neural networks from scratch - even though we can use Tensorflow/ Pytorch, and Watching tons of YouTube videos to understand the math.

lol, I have gone into such madness that I can compute the gradient for a 100-layered network as well. Keeping this aside I am much interested in computer vision. So I had to choose a project and started exploring problems that I see in my day-to-day life.

No matter any corner I choose my idea it is already implemented. I really got frustrated. I observed there is not much to research and explore in regular deep learning. I see only the next leap is emotional AI and power reinforcement learning that mimics humans.

lmao if Elon Musk or Nvidia does it. But the real problem is I am just a student and starting my learning with the basics and don't find an idea to do the project. even if I get it's too complex or I don't know how to build it.

My LinkedIn gets filled up with posts like XYZ company launched an LLM better than ChatGPT. i see AI-wars through LinkedIn and on one side I see folks not finding jobs at all even with good skills and projects. day by day I learn, new applications get released, leaving me miserable.

It feels like I am in a desert and see some water pond. But if I go near it there is nothing but now I see a river at some distance and then finally a see. lol I feel like never get my water

I want the internet to speak. are you folks also in this confusion and stuck? how the fuck are all those people building applications and know every single thing from scratch and how do we create applications. On the other hand lots of research in AI. 100's of papers every single day.

The best suggestion I know I would get is to continue learning. But bro I don't have the fuki\*g time that's the problem. every recruiter I see what they are looking for people in AI teams. The ability to solve problems and create AI applications.

I sincerely request if you are an AI engineer and have gone through all of this. please share with us a path or a direction to go to.

1g259n7,Airline Pilot Considering a CS Degree,"...errrrrr hey folks, this is your captain speaking.

I'm looking for a bit of context and advice. I've been working in aviation for a few years and am currently at a large airline in the US. I'm in my late 20's and the career path I'm on is mostly working for me. I have decent free time, getting many days off as well as long layovers out on the road, so I've been thinking about doing something with that time.

A few years back I completed most of the Launch School curriculum, a solid software engineering program where I learned the basics from the bottom up. The flying career took priority and I haven't opened a code editor for a few years now. I miss really using my brain. I've been looking at getting a bachelor's in CS at somewhere like WGU. I think with transfers from my degree, a BS in Geology, and the tactical plans I've seen, I could get it done in about a year. The thought of relearning math and new-to-me languages is exciting.

I'm looking to get three things out of it: 1) A fantastic line on my resume to help me stand out for my dream airline job. 2) Establish a solid backup career, do some freelance work in my spare time, and potentially fully transition out of aviation if the right opportunity comes up, or my current industry tanks. 3) Just get back into the joy learning and working towards a goal.

I know the industry isn't that easy to break into right now, but I'm happy where I am, so I'm okay with that given the macro trend for the field is significantly positive. I also suspect I could find a niche given my background, would y'all agree?

So, what am I not seeing or considering? And what other programs might be good to consider as well? I'm in no hurry, but I'd rather not spend the time and money required for a more traditional four year degree. Not married to it being a degree, but it is worth something in my position.",1,1.0,3,2024-10-12 20:31:42,errant_airscrew,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareeradvice/comments/1g259n7/airline_pilot_considering_a_cs_degree/,True,0,False,False,20,Saturday,2024-10-12,2024-10,1.5,3.0,"Airline Pilot Considering a CS Degree ...errrrrr hey folks, this is your captain speaking.

1esussi,Tech Interviews: 8 Years of Secrets (and Some Lies) - How to Win the Game,"Okay, let's be real: job interviews are scary.  But they're also a game, and like any game, you can learn how to play it better.  I've spent years in the tech world, writing code and leading teams. And while my experience is in programming, the things I've learned can help anyone get their dream job.

**1. Shine Online:** Your online presence is like your first impression.  Clean up your social media and make sure your LinkedIn profile looks great. Think of it as your online resume.

**2. Tell Your Story:** Don't just list your jobs on your resume.  Tell a story about what you did and how you made a difference.  Instead of ""Managed a team,"" try ""Led a team to success, exceeding goals by 15%.""

**3. Be the Person They Want to Work With:**  Practice telling stories about your work experiences.  Make them interesting and show how you solved problems or helped your team.  People remember stories more than facts.

**4. Practice Talking About Your Work:**  Even if your job isn't technical, practice explaining what you do and how you do it.  This helps you think clearly and shows you're confident.

**5. Show You're Valuable:** Research the company and the interviewer.  Ask smart questions.  Make them think you have other options, even if you don't.  It shows you're in demand.

**6.  Meet People in Your Field:** Go to events and connect with people online.  Networking is key.  You never know who might help you find your next opportunity.

**7.  Don't Be Afraid to Apply Everywhere:**  The more jobs you apply for, the better your chances.  Even if you don't think you're perfect for a role, give it a shot.

Remember, getting a job is tough, but it's not impossible.  Use these tips, be yourself, and don't give up.  You got this!

1ei64el,MBA vs SDE vs PM next steps after career break,"I was an SDE2 in a FAANG company with 3 years and 8 months of work experience 43 lpa base salary.

I don't think I am a very good developer and hence don't see myself becoming an SDE3 later on. I feel I am more inclined towards a job which requires some interpersonal skills and hence was considering a product manager job. But I have no experience in it. Also, I want a job with a good work life balance and lower stress.
So I want advice on what should I take up next assuming I haven't started preparing for any of these yet -
1. Prepare for GMAT and get into an MBA college directly next year.
2. Apply for SDE2 job roles and transition to product management internally inside the company.

1ebzgla,How the fuck do I make money with freelancing?????,"
I’m an experienced fullstack developer. But my freelancing projects are few and far in between. I mainly chose this field because I was told that I never be out of a job and that even if I’m in between official jobs, I can take on freelancing.

 But that seems not to be the case. I’ve tried. I’ve tried up and between having to pay just for connect to being ghosted and to have nobody clicking on my service I’m at my wits end. 

I’ve tried fiver i’ve tried upwork i’ve tried contra. i’ve tried calling local business i’ve tried going in person to local businesses. 
I’m redoing my portfolio site and resume for the 15th fucking time!!!!

WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO? 

Not to mention the insane state that tech career field is in! I can’t even get my foot in the goddamn door. How the hell am I supposed to do anything with this skill? this is a high and skill and I see developers every day talk about freelancing so casually yet I can barely get a goddamn client. 

What the fuck are y’all doing? I’ve been colding for years and i can’t catch one fucking break. am I supposed to just be the most overqualified person working at McDonald’s? This is absolutely insanity. 

Please tell me what the fuck y’all are doing to just get a single paycheck!!! it’s looking like this was a huge fucking mistake that i’ve wasted years of my life on this USELESS SKILL and I’m honestly about to lose it!!!!!

I had to leave the job and take a break for 5 years as I was not married that time and was not allowed to stay alone. 
Got another dumb job as a software engineer doing nothing and fixing bugs in another country, the salary was good but it killed everything in me.
Tried very hard pushed myself very hard to learn some technologies (that was about 8 years ago) and got another developer job in jsf development in a bank. This project was nice and I was actually working like a software engineer for once in my life. There were sprints and I was doing “development” but hell again I got pregnant and resigned again as my husband was relocating as well. Here comes my baby 1 and then baby 2. I was devastated in those years sick of doing nothing. I started learning React and cleared the basic AWS certification in my second pregnancy. Soon after my second baby I got another job as a software engineer but this time the pay is ridiculously low.

1d99v0x,A bunch of possibly silly questions about CS,"Hello current or future CS enthusiasts, I’m starting college in a little under three months and was prompted by my parents to go for a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. They have no insight whatsoever on the field and just suggested it to me since it pays well and tech is an ever-growing industry. That being said, I have no idea of even the basic concepts of Computer Science. I have heard terms thrown around here and there like declaration, looping, and variable however I do even know the basic level of any coding language. I kind of just formulated a huge list of questions that I had regarding my CS journey as an incoming freshman to hopefully be as prepared as possible. I apologize in advance if this is too much or some of these questions make no sense, I am just genuinely curious and exited to get started on it.



Questions:



What topics can I expect to have to learn in CS? Like for example would I choose to take courses about cybersecurity if that’s what interests me or does the uni system kind of make you learn about everything CS related including software development, databases, etc.



What kinds of jobs can I get with a CS degree? Are there certain ones that are better than others for overall enjoyment or compensation? Does the degree allow versatility between different job types? What does a regular day look like in most jobs that come from a CS degree? Does work-life balance exist in this field?



Besides the base pay in these jobs, are there any other financial incentives or bonuses? 



What is the typical career path straight out of college? Like do I just apply for a title I like under a ton of companies and hope to be hired? Are promotions quite common? Should I try to move around between job titles to gain more experience or try to grow my pay at one company?



Just how important are internships and when should I consider looking for them? Should I have a huge comfortability in coding or are the companies that hire you as an intern kind of expecting to bring you along to teach you? What should I look for in a good internship?



I have just under three months before my college begins. I am currently working full-time (although I intend on quitting once in college) and have just a few free hours a week. During my time off of work, what could I possibly do to try to get a little ahead of the curve in CS? What resources should I consider using in college when I get stuck on a concept? Office hours, Reddit, YouTube tutorials, practice websites?? What does a normal day for a Computer Science major look like? 



For my first semester, I will be taking an intro to programming course. I learned that my uni uses Java for the initial courses. Are there any resources that can teach me Java fundamentals so I can get ahead of the curve a bit for the first few weeks of this class? Also as a freshmen in my first semester, I will have the option to take either an Introductory to Computer Architecture course or a Discrete Structures for Computer Science course. Which one logically makes more sense to take seeing as I have zero prior experience? Also I just wanted to add that I am taking a Calculus 1 course (not that anyone really cares).



How should I go about connecting with other people in this space whether it be fellow students at my college or professionals?



I hear burnout is quite common in this field, how can you avoid it and stay motivated?



Looking a little ahead to my later years of college, do you think I should just go for the Bachelor’s degree in CS or try to shoot for a Master’s degree. Is there any real benefit to getting that Master’s degree? Also I wanted to add that I have aspired to build something of my own (entrepreneurship) growing up. Is CS a major that allows for me to eventually break off during my actual career and begin building my own business based off what I have learned? Should I maybe try going for a double degree with Business and Computer Science since I have interest in both? Is there any real benefit to that or is it just a waste of time?



Almost done I promise. Building off that would it be a good idea to maybe double major in CS and Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering? My older cousin recommended me doing something similar as that is what he is doing. But I have no real clue about the idea.



Lastly, is there anything else you would like to provide? Any other advice or something from your personal experiences that you would either repeat or change if you had to do it again?





Well that’s it. Again sorry for the long and perhaps confusing list of questions I have provided. I thank everyone that is still reading this essay and ask for any tips of navigating CS as a college student. Please DM me if that’s any easier. Once again, thank you.

Besides the base pay in these jobs, are there any other financial incentives or bonuses? 



What is the typical career path straight out of college? Like do I just apply for a title I like under a ton of companies and hope to be hired? Are promotions quite common? Should I try to move around between job titles to gain more experience or try to grow my pay at one company?



Just how important are internships and when should I consider looking for them? Should I have a huge comfortability in coding or are the companies that hire you as an intern kind of expecting to bring you along to teach you? What should I look for in a good internship?



I have just under three months before my college begins. I am currently working full-time (although I intend on quitting once in college) and have just a few free hours a week. During my time off of work, what could I possibly do to try to get a little ahead of the curve in CS? What resources should I consider using in college when I get stuck on a concept? Office hours, Reddit, YouTube tutorials, practice websites?? What does a normal day for a Computer Science major look like? 



For my first semester, I will be taking an intro to programming course. I learned that my uni uses Java for the initial courses. Are there any resources that can teach me Java fundamentals so I can get ahead of the curve a bit for the first few weeks of this class? Also as a freshmen in my first semester, I will have the option to take either an Introductory to Computer Architecture course or a Discrete Structures for Computer Science course. Which one logically makes more sense to take seeing as I have zero prior experience? Also I just wanted to add that I am taking a Calculus 1 course (not that anyone really cares).



How should I go about connecting with other people in this space whether it be fellow students at my college or professionals?



I hear burnout is quite common in this field, how can you avoid it and stay motivated?



Looking a little ahead to my later years of college, do you think I should just go for the Bachelor’s degree in CS or try to shoot for a Master’s degree. Is there any real benefit to getting that Master’s degree? Also I wanted to add that I have aspired to build something of my own (entrepreneurship) growing up. Is CS a major that allows for me to eventually break off during my actual career and begin building my own business based off what I have learned? Should I maybe try going for a double degree with Business and Computer Science since I have interest in both? Is there any real benefit to that or is it just a waste of time?



Almost done I promise. Building off that would it be a good idea to maybe double major in CS and Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering? My older cousin recommended me doing something similar as that is what he is doing. But I have no real clue about the idea.



Lastly, is there anything else you would like to provide? Any other advice or something from your personal experiences that you would either repeat or change if you had to do it again?





Well that’s it. Again sorry for the long and perhaps confusing list of questions I have provided. I thank everyone that is still reading this essay and ask for any tips of navigating CS as a college student. Please DM me if that’s any easier. Once again, thank you.

1bfxhsw,Remote work and burnout,"Hiya, pretty sure it’s gonna be a long one so brace yourself for whoever wishes to read through this.

So I am currently 22 and working full time for almost 2 years now as a mobile(react native) engineer in a product owning big name in my country(Italy ).

The pay is good — still, for my country standards, it’s around the 30k gross mark —, the hours are semi- flexible as in “you do your 8 hours, but can pre/post pone them by a couple of hours— and the workplace overall is pretty chill, nobody is watching you and they really only expect you to get shit done without caring much about when and where.
It also is full remote with free e-learning and it’s full of people much smarter than me I can learn a thing or two from.

So what’s the problem? It’s all so incredibly muddy and gray.

I have just took a sick week off because of a flu  and I’m feeling life being “easy” again: I can wake up without problems, I no longer am anxious, I even canceled my psychologist’s appointment because I was feeling so good I had nothing to tell her, also people have been telling me they noticed how much more relaxed I look.

I feel like I’ve just got out of an hellscape and I really don’t want to go back to writing components and attending useless calls all day for a product I completely and utterly have stopped caring about. 

I’ve been getting nice offers from abroad and I think I’m ready to pull the trigger and get out for good, maybe for some full remote part time abroad gig that surely pays more than the meager pay even top engineers get here.

Now, reality check: it is 5 am and the words “you have nothing to lose but your chains” are echoing in my head, even though the quote is completely in the wrong context. 

Is it really something that could be done? Would it really change anything? I guess that no matter what I’ll end up not caring about the product, but at least I’d like to be covered in gold while not caring.

1asts72,Can someone be good at programming if they are good at Microsoft excel?," I recently had an interesting conversation with a friend. He’s an accountant but is increasingly getting interested in programming. He wants to do what he calls “hardcore” programming (not sure what exactly he means by that). He’s of the view that if you’re good at building logic in something like Microsoft excel (which he uses daily, and is pretty good at), then that skill can be translated into “legit” programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc.

However, I think that there is more to programming than just logic. The amount of effort and hard work that go into mastering a particular language cannot be discounted. Even people who wrote called in one particular language, struggle, at least a little bit when they switch over to another.

My question is, if someone is good at Excel, does that indicate that they will be good at programming in other languages and will be able to become good app developers, web developers etc.?",1,1.0,6,2024-02-17 07:56:46,Magic-mile,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareeradvice/comments/1asts72/can_someone_be_good_at_programming_if_they_are/,True,0,False,False,7,Saturday,2024-02-17,2024-02,3.0,6.0,"Can someone be good at programming if they are good at Microsoft excel?

However, I think that there is more to programming than just logic. The amount of effort and hard work that go into mastering a particular language cannot be discounted. Even people who wrote called in one particular language, struggle, at least a little bit when they switch over to another.

My question is, if someone is good at Excel, does that indicate that they will be good at programming in other languages and will be able to become good app developers, web developers etc.?",71,939,1011,0.028,0.71,0.263,0.9939,Positive,False,True,True

1api99x,Seeking Advice on Transitioning into Freelancing and Creative Coding," Hey everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to this community because I find myself at a bit of a crossroads and could really use some guidance.

A little background about me: I'm 25 years old and graduated with a CS degree back in 2022. Instead of diving straight into the job market, I took a gap year to travel and gain some life experiences. Unfortunately, by the time I started actively applying for jobs, the market began to decline, and I've been facing rejection after rejection ever since.

My only professional experience so far has been a one-semester teacher internship, where I taught high school students how to code in Python. While it was a rewarding experience, it hasn't translated into job opportunities as I'd hoped.

Given the current state of the tech market, I've been considering pivoting towards freelancing. However, I'm not quite sure where to start. I've always been interested in creative coding and graphic design, but my experience in that area is limited since my focus in college was primarily on data analytics. My projects mostly revolve around small apps that utilize databases for tasks like inventory tracking or data management.

So, here's where I could use your expertise: Are there any courses or certifications that you would recommend for someone in my position? I'm open to learning new skills and exploring different paths within the tech industry, but I could use some direction on where to begin.

I'm eager to hear your insights and recommendations.

198rpm6,A task is taking more time than originally expected,"Usually in our scrums I've just been saying I've been working on this one task...mainly because that is all on my plate. If I get something else, it's usually higher priority so I will work on that, and also mention it in the scrums.

But lately my plate has been mostly free with the exception of this one task.

Unfortunately, the company I am working for want to replicate one of its features, generating a report. So they gave me a few reports to replicate with information I get through there API.

But the issue is, the report is broken into 6 sections, and the API doesn't give me a clear indication if this piece of data is eligible, so I feel like I have to do some reverse engineering to understand why one piece of data goes here and another doesn't.

I am not confident in my logic, as it has me go row by row to understand why one piece of data is missing, and why another doesn't belong there. So granted, once I'm done I will like to do additional tests with other reports.

Additionally, because this requires me to do a bunch of tests to confirm this logic, my code will be in dire need of clean up because something are unnecessary, and some logic may be redundant, and I'd like to try to make a better way of generating the data in a cleaner way.

But for now...I'm almost 4 out of 6 of the way through.

I expressed my issues with this task to my boss once and his thoughts were I needed more time to learn the API, but at the time I had other tasks that were a higher priority so I was able to put it in hold up until a few weeks ago when things freed up.

I'd like to explain further so he can understand but I don't want to make a big deal of it, and I feel like I should only elaborate more on this task on why it is particularly challenging and time consuming.

Or at least, I would like to explain it in a short and sweet way where I can quickly mention it in a scrum without taking to much time.

In the past I've had tasks that took more time than expected...but this has been something else. I feel like I am trying to rebuild a product from a company without any guidance, and all I have is just the data, a few sample reports to compare it too, and my own judgement on why things are the way they are in the report.

I am a software Engineer with about about 3 yrs experience . I am currently working for a Retail Company based at Seattle. This is my second company. Previously I used to work for a payment processing company based in the South for about 20 months and my work with my previous company involved a lot of Java and Spring Boot. As a new developer, I was learning a lot in my previous company. I left because the pay was peanuts and it was barely enough for me. In my current role, I got a nice little pay bump from my previous role but the job has been a ""lemon"" when it comes to learning. In my current role, I have not even written any significant code at all. In fact, I have barely written any code in the past 7 months.

My manager who is from the same South Asian Country from where I am advised me that Coding is only for entry level Developers and I should focus on supporting some of my teams systems which are very legacy systems. I do not completely disagree with him and agree that I should understand some the underlying systems but I cannot wrap around my fact that he expects me not to code anylonger. He and my Skip are not willing me to move teams as well as there would be no people left to support our Legacy Systems. I cannot move to a new company due to some immigration concerns right now. What should I do in this case? Can someone, preferrably Senior Devs please help me? I feel like my skills are becoming rusty and the only way, I try to keep my skills up to date are by doing the exercises/activities at Hyperskill([https://hyperskill.org/tracks](https://hyperskill.org/tracks)) and I am also learning a book called ""Spring Start Here"" by Laurentiu Spilica.

I am a software Engineer with about about 3 yrs experience . I am currently working for a Retail Company based at Seattle. This is my second company. Previously I used to work for a payment processing company based in the South for about 20 months and my work with my previous company involved a lot of Java and Spring Boot. As a new developer, I was learning a lot in my previous company. I left because the pay was peanuts and it was barely enough for me. In my current role, I got a nice little pay bump from my previous role but the job has been a ""lemon"" when it comes to learning. In my current role, I have not even written any significant code at all. In fact, I have barely written any code in the past 7 months.

My manager who is from the same South Asian Country from where I am advised me that Coding is only for entry level Developers and I should focus on supporting some of my teams systems which are very legacy systems. I do not completely disagree with him and agree that I should understand some the underlying systems but I cannot wrap around my fact that he expects me not to code anylonger. He and my Skip are not willing me to move teams as well as there would be no people left to support our Legacy Systems. I cannot move to a new company due to some immigration concerns right now. What should I do in this case? Can someone, preferrably Senior Devs please help me? I feel like my skills are becoming rusty and the only way, I try to keep my skills up to date are by doing the exercises/activities at Hyperskill([https://hyperskill.org/tracks](https://hyperskill.org/tracks)) and I am also learning a book called ""Spring Start Here"" by Laurentiu Spilica. Is this enough? What should I do to improve myself as a Software Engineer while not learning anything in my current job?

17xhw9t,Leave a great job with average pay for a small start-up in tech?,"I (M/36) supervise a small construction shop at a university in a HCOL city making $73k per year with annual raises that do not keep up with inflation. There are many benefits that come along with working at the university (paid medical insurance, retirement with Texas Retirement System, lots of time off). I'm single with 2 kids whom I share custody 50/50. I have pretty much maxed out my potential in my line of work and have no formal education. I love everything about my job, the people I work with, my bosses are very hands off and trust me to do my job, lots of downtime to shoot the shit with customers and coworkers. My only problem is I don't see any big raises in my near future, and rent just keeps going up and up. Nearly a year ago, I received a very fortunate invitation from an acquaintance to learn to code from him for free for a few months, and now I'm basically a paid intern for his startup company. It's not a great hourly pay and I only work 5-10 hours a week, but that's not really the point. People pay good money to go to coding boot camps and still no guarantee to have a job afterwards. At some point, he'd like to increase my hours and have me come aboard full time, but I don't think he can yet match my current salary, and cannot offer me any other benefits. I think the closest he can get me to is $60k-$70k. It's a very small company with less than 10 employees, and obviously I don't know if it'll continue to grow, but it could be an exciting opportunity, and at the very least I'm getting paid to learn to code. If I didn't have kids this would be an easy choice, but I feel like it's a little too risky now. What do you think? Any insights are appreciated.

17wlnkv,Network Test Engineer debating move into Full Stack Engineer role,"I am currently a Network Test Engineer.  I do not like this job.

There is also very minimal skills gained in design, implementation, and configuration of network devices and technologies.  There are more reasons, but these are the overarching ones and I can elaborate further if needed.

Recently, a job was posted for Infrastucture Automation Engineer (Full Stack Engineer).  Essentially, you'd be automating processes probably similar to a DevOps role using Python, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc.  I am very interested and passionate in this type of work.

However... my job code/pay band is an E4, and this position is an E3.  My boss said this will be a ""demotion"" in a way, ie. I am a ""Senior"" position and would be taking a lower position.  I could probably make a move into it with the same pay, but he said if ""you want to advance further within the company you will be stuck as an E3 and might not be able to take a leadership role since your an E3"".  Personally, I don't really care about job titles/codes, I don't forsee myself retiring here and the next job I get the coding system will be irrelevant.  I voiced my opinion that Full Stack Engineer is a more prestigious role than I currently work and I will be gaining more valuable skills than my auditing/analysis position currently.

Ok, so I know that the US is known for people working way too much and many European countries are known for having a great work-life balance. However, CS-related jobs are always a bit different, you always get many more benefits than in other fields.

Therefore I have a few questions from devs who live in the USA:

1. How many paid days off a year do you usually get?

2. How many hours a week do you work?

3. Are you expected to work overtime or can you just log off for the day when you're done? (and not look at any messages or anything work related after, this question also applies for weekends)

I know these are kinda basic questions but so many people tell horror stories about the work culture there so I'd like to hear some more experience to see if it's that bad in this field as well.",1,1.0,2,2023-08-28 16:27:13,[deleted],,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareeradvice/comments/163m3t4/do_software_developers_in_the_usa_have_a_good/,True,0,False,False,16,Monday,2023-08-28,2023-08,1.0,2.0,"Do software developers in the USA have a good work-life balance?

15pze8f,How to deal with a Promotion salary raise which feels like an inflation salary adjustment.,"Hello Reddit.

What would you do if you were promoted to Senior 
Engineer (after couple of years since joining a company ) only to realise the total raise is around 10% gross? 

Per my experience a promotion increase usually  10-15%.
In last 2 years the inflation was terrible, as we all know, hence the promotion feels like more of a salary adjustment to inflation, than a real promotion. 

Would you highlight this ""dissatisfaction"" to management ? 

Is even talking about it going to achieve something?

14bywqv,"Year old ""new"" grad at a loss of what to do for career search","Hello everyone. I graduated from a local public university back in May of 2022 with a bachelor's of computer engineering.  I've been struggling to find a career ever since then. Regrettably, I had no internship during school so it's been very difficult to find places even willing to give an interview in the Northeast Ohio area. Unfortunately, I am unable/unwilling to relocate for reasons I will get into later as it's probably less important.

* First big thing first: here's my resume \[[https://imgur.com/a/M98AXZt](https://imgur.com/a/M98AXZt)\]. Please critique it as you see fit. I just want it to be said that I arrived at this resume after consulting with engineering college career fair officials (and they had a present employer comment on it anonymously and they said it was fine),  my colleges career services, and discussions with local recruiters. However, I understand there's literally always improvements to make and there is no perfect resume, so I'm open to all feedback regarding it.
   * A potential big issue here is a large lack of experience and im not sure how to pad this out since I never had an internship or anything. I've been trying to do some leetcode to at least keep my programming knowledge ""in tact"" and practice though.
* Secondly, I have gotten interviews before, however, most of them fall flat after the second interview. Sometimes the first screening interview falls flat for various reasons. However, I don't get to the technical interview tests very often. One employer took me to the technical side and it was a very front end oriented take home assignment, which I have very little experience in. Needless to say, I didn't do too well. I've also gotten a few other technicals but never heard back after most of them. One rejected me but refused to give any feedback or tell me what was wrong with my take home program when it functioned as outlined.
   * Actions I've been taking to address these issues: Ive been slowly trying to do mock interviews with career services but it's hard to find time for it with my work schedule. I've been very very slowly going through the Odin project to try and learn some front end because it seems like every job in existence wants it now but my university didnt require teaching it so Im near clueless about all that, but motivation is difficult to come across as my mental health sinks and decays with every job application thrown into the void while simultaneously hating my current job of fast food which I only have to bring money in to help my dad who I live with, which barely allows me to save anything at all because bills are so expensive even with his income on top of what I bring in.
* Thirdly, about relocating or the lack thereof: I currently live with my father and we rely on each other. I have to help him manage finances and care for our pets and him and help with bills. I'm also one of his only living family members and he's needed me ever since my mother passed a few years ago. There's also other things I have to take care of that I don't want to get into here. Familial and pet obligations aside, I'm also not in a state where I could effectively live on my own or with roommates or whatever it would need. I don't have a vehicle, nor do I have a license, nor do I have the savings to buy a vehicle, nor do I have the income to finance one. I also don't have much credit history and low income and such so I'm not sure id qualify for many renting options across the country or whatever. I dont feel like im 'ready' to live on my own or with a random roomate somewhere yet in life. I also just don't really want to move somewhere else at the moment if im being honest. I'm content where I live for now.

I graduated from a local public university back in May of 2022 with a bachelor's of computer engineering.  I've been struggling to find a career ever since then. Regrettably, I had no internship during school so it's been very difficult to find places even willing to give an interview in the Northeast Ohio area. Unfortunately, I am unable/unwilling to relocate for reasons I will get into later as it's probably less important.

* First big thing first: here's my resume \[[https://imgur.com/a/M98AXZt](https://imgur.com/a/M98AXZt)\]. Please critique it as you see fit. I just want it to be said that I arrived at this resume after consulting with engineering college career fair officials (and they had a present employer comment on it anonymously and they said it was fine),  my colleges career services, and discussions with local recruiters. However, I understand there's literally always improvements to make and there is no perfect resume, so I'm open to all feedback regarding it.
   * A potential big issue here is a large lack of experience and im not sure how to pad this out since I never had an internship or anything. I've been trying to do some leetcode to at least keep my programming knowledge ""in tact"" and practice though.
* Secondly, I have gotten interviews before, however, most of them fall flat after the second interview. Sometimes the first screening interview falls flat for various reasons. However, I don't get to the technical interview tests very often. One employer took me to the technical side and it was a very front end oriented take home assignment, which I have very little experience in. Needless to say, I didn't do too well. I've also gotten a few other technicals but never heard back after most of them. One rejected me but refused to give any feedback or tell me what was wrong with my take home program when it functioned as outlined.
   * Actions I've been taking to address these issues: Ive been slowly trying to do mock interviews with career services but it's hard to find time for it with my work schedule. I've been very very slowly going through the Odin project to try and learn some front end because it seems like every job in existence wants it now but my university didnt require teaching it so Im near clueless about all that, but motivation is difficult to come across as my mental health sinks and decays with every job application thrown into the void while simultaneously hating my current job of fast food which I only have to bring money in to help my dad who I live with, which barely allows me to save anything at all because bills are so expensive even with his income on top of what I bring in.
* Thirdly, about relocating or the lack thereof: I currently live with my father and we rely on each other. I have to help him manage finances and care for our pets and him and help with bills. I'm also one of his only living family members and he's needed me ever since my mother passed a few years ago. There's also other things I have to take care of that I don't want to get into here. Familial and pet obligations aside, I'm also not in a state where I could effectively live on my own or with roommates or whatever it would need. I don't have a vehicle, nor do I have a license, nor do I have the savings to buy a vehicle, nor do I have the income to finance one. I also don't have much credit history and low income and such so I'm not sure id qualify for many renting options across the country or whatever. I dont feel like im 'ready' to live on my own or with a random roomate somewhere yet in life. I also just don't really want to move somewhere else at the moment if im being honest. I'm content where I live for now.

1481jhb,Should I quit my current work?,"I have been working on a project for some time now. When I first accepted the job, it looked like it would take 1-2 weeks at best, but we just kept adding new features and expanding it. This has gone on for around half a year now. I started to get disinterested in the project as I couldn't see the end to it anymore, and at first I wanted to get a small gig before starting my own project that I had been thinking about for some time now. Honestly, for the last 2 months, everything started to go in circles, and I hate it. We keep going back and changing small aspects again and again, hoping that this time it would start generating some profit (the person I am developing the program for pays me an hourly rate, so this part mainly interests him). I cannot see this going anywhere, and I am pretty sure this will just keep losing him money as long as he keeps changing the same things around like he is doing. I really want to get over this project and stop working on it to start something new. I used to enjoy coding and working on my stuff so much, but after working on this project, all my passion feels like it has been sucked out of me. It has generated a huge amount of stress and dissatisfaction, way more than any other project I had before. I feel even worse than the projects I worked months on and didn't get paid for. So I really want to quit my current job, as you can understand.  


  
Now the main problem starts with me being the only developer and the project being very out of the ordinary. I really do not believe that he can find someone who can take over and continue development. The project is as good as dead if I leave. I know that the person I am working for paid me a lot of money (even if the pay is shit, 5 months of labor does account for something at the end when you add all of it up). Don't get me wrong; I did deliver on my promises and kept a good pace of development. So he actually got what he paid for and what we agreed on, but he keeps adding more stuff to do and expanding, so the project doesn't actually come to an end. So my question is, should I leave and probably ruin the project? What do you guys think? Is leaving and ruining everything arrogant? Or am I just being naive? This will be my first time ditching the employer and not the other way around, so I am not really sure what to do. Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question. I just didn't want to make a really bad decision and regret it afterwards, so I thought getting some feedback wouldn't hurt.

13rrxzn,Make sure your resume is as good as your technical skills,"I don’t know who needs to see this, but please consider this advice when job searching.

Your resume is the single most important piece of information for your job search.

It’s more so important than your technical aptitude.

A typical basic graduate CS job in any small company will attract hundreds of applicants. Bigger or well known companies will attract thousands.

Your application is not read when it arrives.

Your resume is passed through a program looking for key words and is ranked.

The top 10 or so are then passed to hiring managers/HR for further reading.

You want your resume to be in this pile of 10-20 applications. This is the only place that short listing occurs from, where the interviews are organised.

It needs to stand out, but not with imagery and pretty pictures, they just waste space.

Soft skills are important; some appreciation of estimation and scoping, source control, design patterns are useful to understand even if you can’t implement.

You’ll be tested for your coding abilities, but only after you’ve been short listed and successfully interviewed. Even then, attitude and passion is more important.

As a graduate, your technical skills don’t matter, you WILL be retrained on the job.

People without skills get hired all the time, and get chances they can grasp and thrive in.

If you’re not getting interviews, forget your technical skills for a while and focus on your resume, selling yourself and your soft skills.

Oh, also, if you don’t already have one, start blogging. That’s where you can let your personality show through while showcasing technical skills. If you can get a hiring manager reading some of your posts, they’ll see far more then a one page resume would ever show.

Like perhaps there's a better way to apply than LinkedIn? Normally I would go to the LinkedIn job search and filter by remote + entry level/associate + within a week, and then just apply to everything that I thought I would be a good match for.

I lost hope and gave up, but I've been getting bored with my current job and commuting so I want to try again. How can I increase my chances of landing a remote job?",73,809,883,0.061,0.809,0.13,0.7889,Positive,True,False,True

116edg8,Quitting and starting a business?,"For quite some time, I had been considering the idea of quitting my job and trying to start my own software business.  I wanted to get some feedback on what others might think -- especially professionals who had done something like this themselves.  Here are reasons for me to want to make this decision:

* I currently don't have too much motivation to do my job, and there is often low moral on the project.
* I want more freedom to be creative and inventive instead of having to push so hard for anything to be done.
* I want to be able to follow through with ideas instead of people meddling with them to such a degree where they no longer address the problems the solutions were intending to solve.
* I had already been involved with almost all aspects of software development (front-end, backend, devops, support tasks, etc.), so I would have the ability to do these things on an independent project.
* I have the ability to work independently -- in fact, I have always been able to do my best work when working alone.
* I have enough money saved and low enough expenses to be able to go three years without earning any income before going broke, so there isn't too much of a time pressure.
* I want to be able to spend a few weeks researching better ways of investing the money that I have, instead of most of it just sitting in a savings account.
* I want a better work-life balance with more control over my time so I can live a healthier life.
* I want to be able to integrate learning into my work schedule so I can expand my knowledge and skills in a range of areas.
* If this doesn't work out, I can always have the option of trying to find a regular job again.

* The economy might make it difficult to find new work if being self-employed doesn't work out.
* Starting a business is hard and it can take a long time to become profitable.
* I don't know if I would be able to maintain motivation and keep productive without some external pressures.

10wx1ib,A degree in computer science or engineering,"I would really appreciate any advice or personal experience from
you guys (especially Australians and Canadians).

I (CS IB student) am currently having difficulties choosing
whether to apply for bachelor's degrees in some sort of computer
engineering (software, computer science, data science) or
whether I should apply t degrees in computer science, especially
ones that focus on a major in cyber security.

My parents (especially my mother), want me to apply only to
engineering degrees, but I don't see the point in studying a 4-5
year course if it doesn't lead me directly to my desired field of
study and work (digital forensics or something in cyber security).
After my bachelors I do plan on studying a master's degree in
cyber security and as far as I know, I can apply for them with
any sort of related computer science background degrees
(engineering, Beng).

My only worry with studying a computer science degree,
majoring in cyber security is that by studying a more specialed
course, it will be hard to change fields in the future if I do decide
to.

So in summary, I'm looking for advice as to whether I should
pursue purely cyber security or whether I should be that ""golden
child"" and apply to engineering courses instead to keep my future
prospects broad.

P.s. Does anyone about employability with those holding more
specialised bachelor degrees or those with engineering degrees?
I've heard that companies favour those with a bachelor in
engineering, however, I'm not sure as to how true that is.

10w52xq,Senior/Staff engineer: I’m drowning in Junior dev defects,"I’ve got 10 years experience, am working for one of the Fortune 500. 

At my company, there are two Junior developers who have overinflated titles. One is a senior, software engineer, and the other is a front-end engineer.

I was not allowed to technically review the skills of either before hiring them. Red flag, I know—I’ve since made it clear I want to technically review future candidates. Both were ok cultural fits. 

Last week I was heads down on a separate project from either of the ones we normally work on. During this time, the front end engineer who I trusted with production release, manage to break production. Not a huge deal, it’s just a simple react app, and I quickly reverted it.

But prod broke. And there was a positive assertion by the front end engineer that it had already been reverted. 

This is exemplary of of all of their work. It seems that every time they handle a feature more complex than add style X here or create component M, they break something, don’t _quite _ make it work right, or do an odd, non-abstracted, non-idiomatic copy/paste solution. (E.g using a regex for known-domain value comparison(instead of a=[1,2,3]; a.contains(value) )

I brought these concerns to my scrum master and manager a couple times.
We have responded by implementing a code freeze to allow our SM to QA the work to be deployed. Last release, the FE engineer blatantly ignored that process—or misunderstood it. No questions were asked of me and help was not sought. 

This is just the last in a long line of errors and bugs that I’ve caught. It seems code cannot be developed without bugs by these two!

I think the root of the matter is apathy—they just don’t care, or they’d be more careful. And if they did care, they’d ask questions. 

At this point, I’ve updated my résumé, and have started the application process.

Other than jumping ship, are there other approaches I can take? I’d rather stay here, as the compensation:effort ratio is quite pleasant.

10maik8,Changing careers at 37. Any advice based on my situation?,"A quick summary of what I am good at, and what I am looking for.

I have worked in many fields. I don’t have a degree, but I can learn anything if I want to bad enough. I have an analytical / creative mind. I like designing, but also problem solving. I am a certified electrician, and I own 2 small businesses which I will be parting with this year. I have learned I enjoy work best when I am doing things like coding and building things on the computer. I will leave electrical and “being my own boss” behind and just seeking a well paying job that I can hopefully work remotely (even if it takes me a year or two to land a remote job).

I started working on a Data Analytics path last month after doing some research, but before I commit any further I wanted to explore other paths like Software Dev / Engineer. Ultimately, I want a career that isn't going to get automated out of existence in 10-15 years (something that looks increasingly possible to some extent with data analytics). 

I have a good eye for design and such, I am very artistic, but I feel like the front-end dev sector is quite saturated, so I was kind of exploring the idea of pursuing a full-stack developer path, though I am not sure what the fastest entry into this would be that would allow me to make money early on, and continue to grow my skill set.

The next 12 months I will have a substantial amount of free time as I part ways with my businesses and study study study. Assume I have 0 experience, but I am a quick learner, and very adaptable.

Any advice based on my situation? A quick summary of what I am good at, and what I am looking for.

I have worked in many fields. I don’t have a degree, but I can learn anything if I want to bad enough. I have an analytical / creative mind. I like designing, but also problem solving. I am a certified electrician, and I own 2 small businesses which I will be parting with this year. I have learned I enjoy work best when I am doing things like coding and building things on the computer. I will leave electrical and “being my own boss” behind and just seeking a well paying job that I can hopefully work remotely (even if it takes me a year or two to land a remote job).

I started working on a Data Analytics path last month after doing some research, but before I commit any further I wanted to explore other paths like Software Dev / Engineer. Ultimately, I want a career that isn't going to get automated out of existence in 10-15 years (something that looks increasingly possible to some extent with data analytics). 

I have a good eye for design and such, I am very artistic, but I feel like the front-end dev sector is quite saturated, so I was kind of exploring the idea of pursuing a full-stack developer path, though I am not sure what the fastest entry into this would be that would allow me to make money early on, and continue to grow my skill set.

The next 12 months I will have a substantial amount of free time as I part ways with my businesses and study study study. Assume I have 0 experience, but I am a quick learner, and very adaptable.

Any advice on what might be a good direction to investigate? Any examples or information would be greatly appreciated.

10lw5s6,Best resources for mastering networking and security for a backend software engineer?,"I'm a software engineer with 7 years of experience, and have been primarily a backend engineer for the past 3 years. Fifteen years ago I had a pretty thorough knowledge of these networking and security, and even had studied for the CCNA. Unfortunately these skills have atrophied a lot, and in my current backend job I rarely need to think about these subjects as most of the security model has already been developed for the services I'm responsible for, and any network concerns are handled by our operations guy or networking team.

I know a thorough understanding of the HTTP spec would be useful, as well as really understanding DNS and OAuth.  What other topics are most relevant to a senior backend engineer, and what are the best resources to learn from?

Having worked for the same company over many years I've gradually added responsibilities and increased my knowledge and skill set by trying to improve myself on a yearly basis.

The past two years I've contributed to our code base with bug fixes and the occasional feature, but more recently have been writing more code than ever. Being a small company I've been fortunate to be close to the dev team and I try to learn from them at any opportunity.

I brought it up with my boss and he could see me transitioning into a 70% development / 30% support role with one large caveat.

In order to achieve this I need to work hard on reducing my support related work load by working with our partners and their tech leads so they can do a lot of the crap work I have to do; This might take time and might not be a success.

I've always wanted to be an engineer and have been considering this more seriously the past few weeks. I found qualifying classes and degrees I can do online (proper universities that also provide lectures etc online). It should be more than possible to get a b.s in engineering this way.

Having an engineering degree would open a lot of doors for me on the job market; Looking for a different job is not appealing due to my education primarily being in IT.

f31mfv,Questions regarding on the job training," 

Hello Everyone!

I have some questions about training and what is considered normal. I've been working as a SOA dev for a year and am hating every minute of it. What I am trying to determine is whether or not it is entirely on me.

Background: In January of 2019 I was hired as a consultant fresh out of college (0 dev experience) and placed at a client location as a SOA developer (IBM Datapower). During my time here, the senior SOA dev in the consulting firm left after having reluctantly provided some very weak KT sessions. Company hired another experienced dev, who left within 4 months and provided support but no real training. For the past 6 months or so, I've been completely on my own with no support but somehow making it work. I approached my boss multiple times about training and lack of support, but nothing ever came of it. Today I approached him about a transfer to a different account and he blew up at me about how I was responsible for my own training and this was entirely on me.

My question is this: To what extent am I responsible for my own training? I was put in a job that I have literally 0 experience with, given no practical training, given no support, and have been struggling to understand my job in general. I have done everything short of going to a $1000 IBM training to help me understand my job, but to no avail. I've managed to scrape by until recently. Is this on me?

\-No otj training

f01mme,Trying to Transfer to a New Department,"*Throwaway.*

I work for a large company in the US with a lot of different offices and divisions. For 1.5 years, my boss has been extremely unprofessional, has shown very little interest in my work, and has generally made me and my team members feel unwelcome. He's been there for 15 years, so I really don't think this man is leaving any time soon. Retirement is also a good while off.

Despite this, I like the company/perks and would like to stay. I successfully interviewed for a position in another office and ""got"" the job contingent on one last hoop to jump through. **It is company policy that they must have a conversation with my current manager before making an offer to me. I was not aware of this until the hiring manager told me the next step in the process.**

While I'm a good dev with good performance reviews, my boss has been known to be vindictive toward people who try to leave. He still bitches about a coworker who left in May for another company and how ""disloyal"" he was. 

My problem:

1. I do not have any official offer letter, they can easily say the conversation did not go well and not make an offer
2. If the conversation doesn't go well, and I'm not offered the job, there will be consequences with my current job (harassment, bad reviews, possible termination)

I'm not sure how they're allowed to do this given the compromising position it puts employees in, but hey, it's their company.

1. I do not have any official offer letter, they can easily say the conversation did not go well and not make an offer
2. If the conversation doesn't go well, and I'm not offered the job, there will be consequences with my current job (harassment, bad reviews, possible termination)

I'm not sure how they're allowed to do this given the compromising position it puts employees in, but hey, it's their company. 

Given all of this, should I just say no thanks and look else where?",38,1492,1531,0.079,0.865,0.055,-0.4188,Negative,False,True,True

I'm a senior software engineer that has been working for a small company for the last 12 years. The company is settled in a third world country, and we ship software outside. My wage is not bad for the country/location (I'm the highest-paid employee) I like my boss and the work I do. The work/life balance is very good. However, for the last 5 years, I had only a 2% salary average raise yearly, and during those five years, I got a lot of new obligations (got married, had a kid, etc). I'm the lead developer, I get to have the last word on every technical decision for the company, from the tech stack of a project to the people on the teams. On my role, I also get to write technical specs. and clarify business needs to the teams. During those years I got fluent in the business side of our domain (corporate finance). Some years ago I tried to buy equity but my boss wasn't interested. I know I'm a linchpin for this company and they wouldn't like me to leave at all. Now I'm getting an offer by a friend that funded a startup. They are growing a lot, and he is offering me nearly a 2.5X salary increase and he already talked that if I wanted equity, he could offer me stock options after some time. They want me as the CTO. I would need to relocate and after three months, they offered me being able to work remotely.  


I'm wondering what should I do, I don't want to disappoint my current boss, and I would love to keep contributing to this company. We have built a very good relationship during those 12 years. This guy is very nice, he hired me when I was just a youngster. I feel the company is part of me (even if I don't own anything) and I know they will have a very hard time if I leave completely.   


I have thought about trying to end up as a consultant for the current company, giving them an hourly rate, and going full time to the new place, but I don't know if that would work. I'm a bit lost.

dq37ai,What to do in MSc to optimise possibility of getting a PhD position?,"Hello!

I am a first-year MSc student in computer science at a no-name university (100-150 ranking). During my undergrad I had the goal of working for early-stage startup or starting my own. I ended up working for one during my undergrad and got good connection to the local startup scene and learned a bunch about building web applications. I invested a lot of time working and building contacts, but in the end I realised it was not really for me. The environment felt too opportunistic, and even if I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and realised I personally value quality more than getting stuff out fast.

Now I've started consider doing a PhD after my studies, thinking it's still a fast-paced hard-working environment, but more focused on getting things right rather than fast. I see it as a way to specialise in an area I am interested in (I have a couple in mind that i gonna explore during MSc) and it also seems like a requirement to get any kind of R&D position in industry. 

I realised though I invested my time during undergrad in a really bad way from a grades perspective. I worked on extra-curricula AND took extra courses, resulting in really bad grades.

What can I do to optimise my possibility of getting a PhD position? Are good grades a requirement or can more academically-inclined side-projects be worth as well? Any advice of things to think about during MSc is greatly appreciated.

There is two research project courses I plan to take during my MSc (besides the thesis), and I guess it's a good idea to check out what area I am interested in and also participated in conference student paper contests.

I have 4.5 years' experience as a PM in digital/web space at a marketing-tech services company and 3 at Microsoft (2 years in a rotational PM program in Microsoft IT). I don't have experience running, managing or launching internet scale products at SaaS or product-centric companies but, yet, this is where I want to go - owning and driving success for products people love to use and/on pay money to use. I believe this is what is holding back hiring teams and managers from proceeding into detailed conversations with me, I do get a TON of bites and invites to interview given the # of years of experience I have and the market at the moment, however, nothing materializes cuz I believe there's better applicants with actual PM experience out there.

Should I keep pursuing SaaS product roles? If not right now, how should I work on my profile before moving in this direction? What about an MBA? Looking for advice and guidance, kinda feeling lost.

Any advice will be appreciated. This may not be the right forum to ask this question, so feel free to point me to the right place if you know of one.

clb7ab,Leaving a company because of the tech I'm working with?,"Right now I'm working for a company that is great in general. I've been here for about 3 1/2 years. Has a great culture, good work life balance, although the work is highly dependent on what project you get put on.

I love doing Spring Boot + Angular, or anything similar to it, but this project that I've been on is really wearing me down and I feel like I'm at the point where I want to leave.

As far as the company goes, it is a large retail company, that is trying to make the push to newer tech and becoming ""omnichannel"". My main issue right now is the technology I have been working on. I went from doing full stack development with popular languages/tech that I enjoyed, to now the past **year** been working on a proprietary technology that seems like it hasn't been updated since the late 90s. This past year I've been working with a sort of drag and drop application used to build integrations (TIBCO). And while it's nice to have it as a tool in my belt and will prove useful in the organization, I didn't expect to be working with it for so long. The project was advertised as using all the latest and greatest technologies to get the job done, but turned into creating multiple integrations with this software and I absolutely hate it.

The worst part is, it doesn't look like there is any end in sight, and I could be working with it for the months to come. Me and my team completed the project ahead of schedule, went and set out everything we promised and delivered. Product owner and business is happy with our work.

I don't mind biting the bullet and working with it for a month or so but now I'm worried about my career growth as a developer and being pigeon-holed into this tech in future projects. I was told that I would be moving off it soon, months ago and every time I ask my manager when I'm getting put on another project it seems like there is no definite answer. I also feel like I'm not being rewarded properly for a great effort, with a technology that I hate and is outside my job description. When I asked my manager if I could be promoted, and listed my accomplishments he kind of just nodded but kept giving excuses why I'm not there yet, despite doing a ton for the organization. I've even been doing organization wide Angular training, every month for the past 2 1/2 years (even though this past year I haven't even been able to touch Angular).

bv8wlk,Need advice I should leave a cozy/comfortable job or transfer to a company,"Hi, firs time posting here. I just wanted the general consensus on what is the appropriate reasons to leave a cozy job. Cozy meaning you don't really do alot at work you are not busy but most of the time you are bored. Is this a sign that you should move and look for another opportunity? I've been feeling bored at work and demotivated at work for some time now since I am not really doing anything I find meaningful. Most of my tasks are menial and does not ignite the spark I once used to when I joined the organization.

&#x200B;

I used to be very busy. Doing a lot of things but now that we have new hires I find it odd that I barely do anything during the sprint. Mostly the new hires works on those tasks. and they consult me on they should implement it. I still work but most of the interesting tasks I give it to them since they are now and I want them to learn but at the same time I am bored as hell. And most of the time I am little bit frustrated with our chief architect. He is not open for other technology recommendation. it's always his way or the highway. Is this a sign I should pursue a new opportunity?

So what about the new opportunity? Well the opportunity offer a 30% increase of pay. Performance bonus of x4 my base pay (I dont have this at my current) compared to what I have.  but the company I am currently working is stable(I just assumed it is since we have parent company same goes to the new company that gave me an offer)

bqv143,Advice on pitching a new role,"First, some background.  I'm a senior developer on a team of about 10 people, working in the IT cost center of an insurance company.  We are responsible for a web application that is an internal line of business application.  I have a BS in computer science and also hold an MBA.  I've waffled in the past on delving into management, but my heart is not in it.  I love to be hands on with coding, and more recently, I've grown to appreciate/enjoy the work involved in deployments/containerization/cloudifying applications.  

I've recently read the Phoenix Project, and I'm a complete believer in the business value of having a dialed-in deployment pipeline.  Small batch delivery, kanban, single piece flow, etc.  My team currently has deployments automated behind a single button click.  We are definitely the front-runners in our entire company in this aspect.

We had a new VP (2 levels above me) come in about a year ago.  He came in touting ""innovation"", but has recently backed off of that war cry, and has become more fixated on process consistency across teams.  The sales team is unable to articulate any real competitive advantage that could be gained from feature sets or tech capability.  The best they can do is concede that we are a sales driven development company, which means that they just agree to whatever a client asks for and then put the dev teams on the hook to deliver.  This mostly amounts to client-specific features and customizations.  Also worth noting, the users are internal to the company.  The clients only care about the artifacts that come out of the software, such as reports, letters, invoices, etc.

Now to the actual CS career question.  My boss is on the outs.  I've voiced directly to the VP that I'm bumping my head on the ceiling as an individual contributor, and that status quo with <2% annual raises is not satisfactory for me.  So he asked me to pitch to him what role I feel would add business ROI and play to my strengths.  I told him that I insist on remaining hands-on, even if I have people reporting directly to me.

Because the stated and operational goals of the business seem to be:
1)Let's spend as little as possible (pretty much goes without saying in the IT Cost Center)
2)We expect IT to turn around any and all requests as quickly as possible, with quality assumed
3)We would rather buy software solutions than build them
4)Move from on premise hosting to cloud (on a pretty lazy timeline)

I'd rather focus on one team than have a cross cutting concern for many teams.  I'm thinking of pitching some type of cloud architect role that I'd like to take on, but I need some ammo to make a business case.

He came in touting ""innovation"", but has recently backed off of that war cry, and has become more fixated on process consistency across teams.  The sales team is unable to articulate any real competitive advantage that could be gained from feature sets or tech capability.  The best they can do is concede that we are a sales driven development company, which means that they just agree to whatever a client asks for and then put the dev teams on the hook to deliver.  This mostly amounts to client-specific features and customizations.  Also worth noting, the users are internal to the company.  The clients only care about the artifacts that come out of the software, such as reports, letters, invoices, etc.

Now to the actual CS career question.  My boss is on the outs.  I've voiced directly to the VP that I'm bumping my head on the ceiling as an individual contributor, and that status quo with <2% annual raises is not satisfactory for me.  So he asked me to pitch to him what role I feel would add business ROI and play to my strengths.  I told him that I insist on remaining hands-on, even if I have people reporting directly to me.

Because the stated and operational goals of the business seem to be:
1)Let's spend as little as possible (pretty much goes without saying in the IT Cost Center)
2)We expect IT to turn around any and all requests as quickly as possible, with quality assumed
3)We would rather buy software solutions than build them
4)Move from on premise hosting to cloud (on a pretty lazy timeline)

I'd rather focus on one team than have a cross cutting concern for many teams.  I'm thinking of pitching some type of cloud architect role that I'd like to take on, but I need some ammo to make a business case.

bh7lsq,Got a $1100/month internship offer. Should I take it? [High School],"Hey everyone,

First, some context: average salary in my country is $34,150 USD. Average software engineer salary doesn't seem to be much higher, at around $40,000 per year.

I'm a junior in high school with a bunch of CS projects and hackathon awards. Recently I applied and interviewed for a CS/Data Science job at a firm who's job is to basically help businesses increase customer yield rates (kinda boring but they use interesting tech). The company is quite big, 35+ employees, has it's own 4 story glass building, etc. I got offered $1100/month for 2 months during the summer, which is apparently their standard intern rate. The job is a 9 am - 6 pm with a one hour lunch break, 5 days a week. Effectively I'd be working for $6/hour.

Before anyone tells me to negotiate, I sort of messed up here - when they asked me how much I wanted initially, I considered that I'm about half as valuable as an actual software engineer so I asked for $2k a month (if an actual software engineer is worth 48k per year, half of a software engineer is 24k and then per month that's 2k) but that was apparently too high. I then asked what's the typical intern salary and they said 1100 USD a month so I stuck with that.

Is 1100 USD (approximately $6/hour) an okay rate, or should I insist on more?

Sorry if I come off as ungrateful or braggy, I really don't mean to. This is my first time getting an internship offer and I know that this usually doesn't happen for high-schoolers, I just want to know if I'm being scammed.",2,1.0,3,2019-04-25 14:42:08,sourcethatshitbro,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareeradvice/comments/bh7lsq/got_a_1100month_internship_offer_should_i_take_it/,True,0,False,False,14,Thursday,2019-04-25,2019-04,1.0,3.0,"Got a $1100/month internship offer.

banzsp,Should I switch teams to learn big data tools?,"Currently employed at a large company and been offered an internal transfer. I'm debating if I should make the switch. I've been at my current role for almost three years and think highly of my team. This is my first job out of college. My manager is great, experienced, very supportive. My main concern is that I feel like working with the cloud/big data is becoming more and more important. I am concerned that the current tech I am working on is not really transferable (it's very company-specific).

There is a different team internally that I was referred to by a friend. They use an interesting and more widely-used tech stack with Hadoop/Spark. I don't have much experience with big data/cloud tooling and am interested in learning. However, the new manager is inexperienced and defers decisions to their manager, who is apparently very opinionated.

There is another member on their team who is leaving. I asked the individual who is leaving the team for their candid thoughts. This person said the team is good to work with, with the exception of the opinionated manager, who has been known to say things that will want to make people cry. The leaving team member made it seem as if the opinionated manager has a bit of a short fuse, which is worrisome if this manager makes unilateral decisions. 

If I join the new team, I could learn a new tech stack and transferable skills. However, my current work environment is great and I am concerned that the new team might not be as supportive.

Other considerations are that I may take up to 10k cut when it comes to annual bonuses and that they are less flexible when it comes to working remotely, etc.

ah4t3a,Working is harder than university,"Getting a computer science degree was not exactly easy, but had no problem graduating with a high GPA.  Now that I have my first real job, I'm finding it to be challenging.  I just want to vent about some of these sources of frustration, if you don't mind.

Absolutely nothing is documented.  There are no comments in the source code.  The available wiki is barren of information.  There's no way of knowing what to expect from the external systems connected to our project.  It seems the only way to get any information about anything is by talking to someone who already knows it, but most of the people who worked on the project are no longer around.  I don't buy that whole ""software should be self documenting"" idea -- source code can tell what is happening and describe what things are, but it cannot say anything about the reasons or motivation behind the decisions being made.  The code alone doesn't say, ""One of our stakeholders, on a whim, decided it should be this way because he thought blah, blah, blah."" or ""This is a hack workaround because there is a bug in this other system that needs to be fixed, but I don't want to wait for someone else to fix it.""  The source code says what it is doing, but there is no way of knowing if what it is doing is really what it is suppose to be doing.

Often there is no one you can talk to to try to help try to help figure things out.  Since nobody around knows how it works, any attempt to discuss challenges falls on deaf ears.  We have daily stand up, but if you try to talk about anything beyond the basic status of the story your working on, you're told to ""take it offline"" and then nobody wants to talk about it after that.  Even though there is stand up, nobody really knows what anybody else on the team is doing and most of the time each person is doing something completely different and unrelated to everybody else.  Pull request reviews are useless.  Like I said, since nobody knows how anything works, the only thing you can hope to get out of a code review is people pointing out surface level issues like spelling errors or simple programming mistakes.

Hunting down bugs and fixing them is agonizing.  Fixing a null pointer exception isn't too bad, but if there is strange behavior that emerges from the interactions between parts of eighty different source code files, it can be not only hard to even know what the code is doing, never mind trying to figure out what it is not doing what it is suppose to be doing.  Since you're just given a short description of the bug and not any steps on how to reproduce it, it can often be hard to even know where to start looking for the problem.

Because of Agile, everything is hacked together just to get the story to work -- there is no discernible architecture.  Because of this, all throughout the code can be found basically the same functionality re-implemented by several people.  Each of these implementations can be slightly different due to each programmers own understanding of the problem and because often these involve fairly low-level manipulation of data, the database is a mess.

Speaking of the database, it does not use ""not null"" nearly enough.  Fields that should never be null somehow wind up having null in them, so you can never be certain what to expect -- this leads to having to have null checks before the use of every variable.  Part of the problem might be the result of how many people there are frequently going into the database and manually setting values by hand to ""fix"" things enough to appear to be working but the data may likely not actually be correct because they don't know anything about how the software works.  It's chaos.

The only hint of software architecture is in code written over five years ago.  The problem is, it is often written based on naive assumptions about future requirements and tends to do more to obstruct progress than to make things simpler.  Because this code isn't designed to do what needs to be done, you often have to try to waste a lot of time figuring out ways to get around their limitations.  There are clearly problems, but nobody wants to do anything about it because ""it works, so we're not touching it"" and ""it will be too much work to fix.""  The code base can do all the same things and be so much simpler, which can make development quicker and easier, but there is a strong reluctance to refactor anything.  In fact, anything that cannot be directly demoed to the client is considered to be not worth doing.

The most frustrating part for me is when I know exactly what needs to be done but am not allowed the freedom to do it.  I hate being told ""do X"" and then I say ""the only way to do X is if I do Y"" and their reply is ""you can't do Y, just do X.""  That reminded me of the comic with the dog playing fetch, ""No take, only throw!""  ""No refactoring or redesigning, only implement features.""  It's made even worse when, halfway through working on a story, they decide they want to make changes and have it do something different than what the story originally said that it needed to do.

I also don't like how testing is done.  Their idea of testing is to verify that the story has been implemented -- not for the purpose of finding bugs.  Often the tester doesn't know how to do things, so the programmers have to walk him through it.  How is he expected to find anything that the programmers have not already checked and are aware of?

Nobody has said anything to me about it, but because I feel like I've been struggling to get things done I've been feeling on edge.  I don't think I'm meeting the expectations for number of stories completed per month.  Maybe if I were the sort of person who could happily write buggy code and call it done, like some people working there, maybe I wouldn't be having such a hard time.  The problem is, with the way my mind works, I often find hundreds of edge cases where the code related to what I'm working on might fail and I'm not satisfied until I've figured out how to take care of them.  Considering how bad the code base is, this can be extremely frustrating.

So be warned CS students -- this may be what's in store for your future.  A demoralizing grind.  I need to find a new job despite only being here for less than a year.

9v72ud,Need CS Career Advice,"Hello,

I am a programmer in India, and I'm looking for some advice. I studied Mechanical Engineering, and after three years working in factories, I grew tired of the harsh working environment and absurd pay, and went on to a job writing content for one of Amazon's biggest rivals here.

I've been pretty computer savvy, having done a little HTML and Javascript during high school. I learned a little C in college (mandatory course), but I never really learnt much to be useful.

I picked up Python and in the course of a year, I became proficient at it. I got a new job as a developer at a non-software company, and I learned a lot about DevOps and building applications here.

A lot of what I learned is self-taught, mostly from books or youtube. I am confident in my Python skills. I write my own libraries for use at work (I develop parsers and numerical libraries which subclass pandas for use in Computer Aided Analysis) and I have been making things with MicroPython and Raspberry Pis for a year now.

I love coding, and I feel this job has nothing more to offer me. So I began attending interviews at software companies. I want to work at a software company because I feel tired working as a lone wolf, having to spend time discovering things which other developers would know through experience (not knowing that nginx was a thing last year, for example).

My learning process has been slowed down by my lack of CS fundamentals. And I am at a point in my career where I want to focus my career on a path that I can invest the next ten years in (I am 31).

The interviews I go to, I am handicapped by not knowing CS fundamentals. I never have a need for C, for instance, but companies expect me to know at least a little C. I don't know much by way of algorithms, but again, I am expected to.

I know there are gaps in my education that I need to fill, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what I need to focus on. I'd like to be an application developer, make libraries in Python, and build tools that others use. I feel I can offer a lot in this direction.

However, what do I invest my time in learning?

9n2009,Thinking about dropping CS school for a semester. How can I get the best out of it?,"Hey all. I'm in my third year of a CS major in Brazil, and I have no plans on giving up my degree. I really want to graduate, mostly because my parents have really invested their money in my education. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy CS and can't see myself studying anything else, but I'm definitely not the biggest fan of the more theoretical part of CS, which basically makes up the majority of the course. This is not a rant, I knew from the beginning my university focused a lot on this academic part, they have a really strong CS department.

Here's what I would like to get from my CS background: good experience with programming (mainly web development) and computer systems overall. Eventually I would like to start my own business related to tech, and I think someone with a technical background, that can somehow relate to the programmers, is fit to succeeding in the job.

With all of this in mind, I think I need some time away from school to focus on things that I consider to be important when it comes to truly becoming what I aspire to be. Spending my days learning web development, programming my own little projects, meeting new, like-minded individuals, reading and getting to know more about business... things I am not getting at CS school. 

What are my options? Is simply dropping out and learning things on my own a good idea?

I've just received the formal offer letter which I'll need to use to apply for my E3 working visa, and I can't help but feeling there are some clauses that aren't very favourable to me, especially re-locating from such a distance.

After doing some forensics, I'm pretty sure they've used [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) to incorporate the company (in Delaware), and are using the standard [Offer Letter template](https://www.orrick.com/-/media/Public/Files/e/Employee-Offer-Letter.docx) provided by them. You can tell by the link (it also uses the same formatting) the law firm [Orrick](https://www.orrick.com/), which is [used by Stripe Atlas](https://www.orrick.com/News/2016/06/Orrick-Collaborates-with-Stripe-to-Help-Emerging-Market-Entrepreneurs) for legal advice, provide the template.

# ""At Will"" employment

After some research, I've found that this ""At will"" employment is a ""norm"" in the states, which is quite a surprise to me coming from Australia, where the standard is to have a probationary period in which the company can terminate you with two weeks notice, then after the probationary period, they must provide four weeks notice (vice versa for leaving the company). 

I'd like to negotiate this notice period as is in my current place of employment, because if for whatever reason they terminate me, I'd have little to no time to leave the country and return to Australia. If it's what all US companies do.. I could see it being thrown back in my face, but a contract is meant for negotiation, right? 

## Benefits

They've taken out the optional section for employee benefits, which states:

>As a regular employee of the Company you will be eligible to participate  
>  
>in a number of Company-sponsored benefits, which are described in the employee benefit  
>  
>summary that I have enclosed with this letter.

What are these ""Company-sponsored benefits""? Would this include things like healthcare, 401k, etc. I'd also like to negotiate re-location costs, if they would fall under this category. What are the usual benefits you get in a ""normal"" company? In Australia, for instance, 401k (i.e. ""superannuation"" as it's called here) is mandatory, and the employer will deposit 9.5% of your salary into the fund of your choosing. Also the standard ""annual leave"", i.e. vacation, is four weeks here, where as I've been offered 15 days.  

# Equity

They've also taken out the ""Equity Grant"" section:

>Subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors,  
>  
>you will be granted \[an option\] OR \[a right\] to purchase \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shares of the Company’s  
>  
>common stock. The \[option\] OR \[purchase right\] will be subject to the terms and conditions  
>

Does this mean they won't offer me any equity at all / ever? My current company at least offers an ""Employee Share Option Plan"", which you become eligible for after your probation period is finished.

# Other

My current contract explicitly specifies how many hours a week I'm obliged to work for, stating:

>Your nominal hours of work will be 38 hours per week plus any additional hours necessary to  
>  
>enable you to perform the requirements of your position. Your remuneration has been set  
>  
>with this requirement in mind.

Obviously, given I work for a ""start up"" currently, I've worked on average a lot longer weeks (on my own accord), but it's still nice to have in the contract explicitly.

Finally, I'm just overall confused, is this purely an ""offer letter"" or is it my ""contract"". What will be up for negotiation if I sign this document, and what wont be?

If anyone can shed some light to what is normal practice in the US when it comes to these things I'd greatly appreciate it!

92x14c,Considering a degree change from BS Software Dev to BS IT. Would like some opinions please,"This is cross-posted from /r/WGU, but I want to get opinions from a broader audience as well.

I want to do a career change sometime in the next few years. I am currently a tech manager, but have nothing on my resume with any software development.

I am about 65% done with my degree. I've done a comparison between the two programs and if I switch to BS IT, I will be done at about the same time.

My concern is this. I have heard people say before that I shouldn't worry too much about which degree I get, that it won't matter in a few years, but I'd like to hear from some senior devs and software dev hiring managers on whether they would look at someone with a BS IT degree and 5 or 10 years of programming experience differently than someone with a BS Software Dev degree and the same amount of experience. Is this degree change going to hinder me in the future when I'm looking at senior dev positions? Is it going to hinder me when I'm looking positions managing development teams?

My other concern is that I know I'm (most likely) going to have to take a hit in pay to go from management to being a junior dev somewhere. Is this degree change going to make it more difficult for me to get that first junior dev position somewhere? I hear a lot of people saying that they would hire a junior dev without a ton of consideration for which (technical) degree they have, but I don't see very many junior dev positions advertised that don't want at least a year or two of experience and at least a little language-specific knowledge.

8x5jc2,Advice on getting out of team,"Hi all,

TL;DR: Started at company I interned with, new manager turned out to be comically horrible. Not sure how to get out of the situation.

I have recently started full time at a company I had a great time with as an intern and thought the culture would be a perfect fit. It was laid back, my manager was a great mentor and I was encouraged to take initiative or learn about higher level aspects of the team's operations without any micromanagement to be stressed about. It was so great I was fine with somewhat below market salary and benefits for the lack of wear from the ordinary bullshit.

The team was restructured into two sub-teams and I was hired under a different manager, which did not seem like an issue at the time since it was still the same team. Well, I was wrong. To list just a few things about my new manager:

- Extremely micromanaging and refuses to leave any initiative and tries to hold absolute control over higher level aspects of the projects.
- On that note, only gives out tasks under the same project in 30 min - 2 hour crumbs and does not release further details until he is satisfied with those parts.
- Not a good mentor. Unhelpful with any issues that come up, extremely unclear about expectations and disparages people for not meeting them.
- Likely not fit to lead in the first place. Had 10+ years of experience under a rather narrow developer position in a different company before being hired here and does not seem like he actually understands high level aspects of the business to guide people. To the point he can usually only explain things by writing pseudocode and I have never seen an instance of him offering guidance beyond writing code snippets to use or rewording and deflecting the questions people ask.
- Absurdly rigid with schedules. Before the restructuring, people worked 8 hours including lunch. No more paid lunches and his expectation is for people to factor in the 10 mins it takes to get food to eat at their desks now. I have been threatened for leaving 3 mins early one day even though I worked 45 hours that week (exempt of course).
- Not very trustworthy. Often talks about working on projects using tools that were not even in existence at the time he claimed to have worked with them. Also gaslights and displays at least somewhat abusive behavior.

I am convinced I need to get out of here as soon as possible but I am not sure how to go about it. A few ways I can see:

- Address the issue with old manager in other subteam and/or the VP. Most likely a terrible idea as a newbie.
- Shadow someone I have a good relationship under a similar team in different department and switch there. Not sure how to do it without raising suspicions or putting myself in a bad spot.
- Aggressively look for a new position at a different company. I am not exactly in shape and I do not want to take a downgrade as far as my position goes.
- Commit to getting in shape as far as interview skills go and work on some open source while learning at work. Sounds like the best option except the suffocating micromanagement combined with incompetence makes it a bit hard to learn anything. Also I do not really want to suffer through a year of working under Vincent Adultman.

This facility is part of one of the biggest retailers in the U.S. The problem(s) are I'm a staffing specialist 1 year away from graduating with B.S.C.S, this is not part of my job description, I only get 28k a year hourly with the expectation of working OT during peak season and the other two people working on this are not in my department nor do I have regular contact with them. We all have separate jobs that do not correlate. They've been working on the project with a questionable personal server set up in house using facility owned equipment. 

So, should I join in or let this slide? I'd love the experience but I'm not seeing any personal gains from this as I wouldn't be heading or be able to put a ton of time in it. ",18,849,868,0.01,0.929,0.061,0.7894,Positive,False,False,False

8g0tob,Advice on several ideas for master thesis topic,"Hello everyone,
writing from a fresh account because the other one is a little too personal to be linked to professional activities. Thanks in advance for your time!

I am a student pursuing a M.Sc. in Computer Science in Germany. My main interests are in networking and security, and I want to specialize and have a career in this field. I had a seminar on IT-Security and lectures in networking security, communication protocols, peer2peer systems, among others. But I don't have practical experience related to security yet, and I want to use my master thesis to acquire more in-depth knowledge and also to, well, put something relevant on my CV. We all want to be employed, after all.

I brainstormed some possible topics for my thesis and had some ideas, and I would *love* to hear what you all think about them.

1. Privacy Preserving Intrusion Detection [as a service]. Apparently, IDS in cloud services are kind of relevant right now, but not everyone wants to share sensitive data with the cloud provider. Implementing a signature-based privacy preserving IDS and analyzing how fast and reliable it could work under real-life conditions seems interesting.
2. IDS and Firewall for IoT: 'smart devices' sometimes lack basic security protection mechanisms. It could be interesting to build some kind of firewall or intrusion detection system to detect attacks targeted at smart devices, starting with simple things like detecting port scans. Building an IDS specifically for that purpose might be promising. Since IDS normally generate huge amounts of alerts, including false positives, it would require post-processing of the data, e.g. false alarm handling, to manage all that.
3. Perfect Forward Secrecy for Proxy Re-Encryption: Proxy Re-Encryption is used when Alice wants an incoming message that is encrypted for her to be decryptable by Bob, too, without sharing her private key with Bob. The semi-trusted third party Claire gets a special key to ""transform"" the message so that it can be decrypted by Bob, without being able to decrypt the message themselves. The open issue her would be to achieve perfect forward secrecy for all three participants of this exchange, which seems like a math-heavy and a little intimidating endeavour.
4. Something with TLS 1.3? Since TLS 1.3 just went out of draft state, it would be interesting to do something with it - implementing, analyzing, whatever. But I have no clear idea about this right now. Ideas welcome!


Are any of those vague ideas actually promising? What would you recommend? Any other great ideas for topics in the networking/security area? Any comments are *highly* appreciated, thank you all very much!

75wj1y,Applying for Graduate Position in other European countries,"I'm curious about what's the best way to go about applying for Graduate positions within another european country. 

I'm assuming that I'll be at a competitive disadvantage compared to graduates within their own European country. 

I imagine tailoring my curriculum vitae to the job will help but is their any other advice you could suggest to secure a position outside of my own country from here? Or is it generally easier to first move abroad and try to secure a job while within the desired destination?

My boss approached me the other day saying he is trying to push for me to get a promotion, which is something we discussed a while ago. He said they doing them right now, but is trying to push it through, and wanted to know i will be committed because he will look bad if he pushes for it and i leave shortly after. I played it off a bit and dodged the question as i wasnt exactly sure what to say.

I dont want to burn any bridges here since i respect him, and he is well connected in the company and maybe i would want to work with him again some day.

6oz7dc,College level advice,"I am a CS student going into my junior year, and I live in an area that has next to nothing in terms of programming internships, and you basically have to know someone inside to get an interview at the geek squad in this town (they wanted someone with the A+ cert or equivalent, and I tutor A+ and didn't even get talked to). I think I have an internship set up for next summer, but in case that doesn't work out, do you know of any other way I could make money off of programming? Places like upwork.com seem like it's impossible to get any reasonable money. Being as I tutor computer science for my University, I'm tired of having to find manual labor jobs for the summer.

638gx0,"Applying for a local company as a ""data specialist"". Any advice would be helpful!","Sorry this is sort of long, just need to explain this situation as best as I can. Currently I work for a local tech company in my town. I have never had any IT experience prior to this job (one year of business admin classes in college and dropped out) and only worked retail. I love technology so I figured it would be a great career path for me. They needed someone with excellent customer service that they could train. We have about 100-150 clients around my town that we service, and I was visiting our largest client that said they were going to leave our company as they want an in-house tech. They asked me if I would be willing to take it as it is better pay and benefits and Since we all know how they work their along with their software, etc. I am more than willing as I know a lot of their system, however over the last year working for my company now, I have not completely been familiarized with their system/server/workstations as in-depth as I want to be able to transition them away from my current company and for me to be able to manage it. They will pay for any training I need at this new company, so what I am basically asking is what do I need to look into and where do I start to be able to manage all of their data and info and get the transition to be as smooth as possible if they give me the job? It's going to be a mess if this falls through, but I just need to get started with the transition and find proper training to continue to service them efficiently.
